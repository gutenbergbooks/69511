<p class="center">“NOBLY REWARDED!”</p>


<p>“Take care—that engine is going to run wild!”</p>

<p>Those words, yelled out by a brawny mechanic,
announced a moment of excitement in the Saxton
Automobile Works, the home of the celebrated Estrelle
machine.</p>

<p>The big steam engine of the plant had slipped the
belt. There was a jar and then a crash. Then the
big driving wheel of the engine began speeding like
an uncontrollable monster. Clouds of steam covered
the boiler room like a snow bank. The machine
shop gearing snapped and vibrated, and the building
began to shake from end to end.</p>

<p>One big man with a shout of dismay ran for the
front of the shop, and disappeared through its doorway
into the street. This was Jasper Saxton, the
owner of the establishment. His example was followed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
by several of the clerks in the glass-partitioned
office at the front of the building. Most of
the twenty odd machinists in the shop, however,
stuck to their posts.</p>

<p>“Danger—look out!” shouted old Caleb Dunn,
the foreman.</p>

<p>Every man at a lathe immediately slipped the belt
of his special machine. Those at the further end of
the shop did not attempt this. They dodged and ran
away from their posts of duty.</p>

<p>There was a reason for this. One end of the
big shaft nearest the engine had dropped. The jar
of the engine had either broken a connection of the
shaft or it had slipped a bearing. At all events, the
shaft had taken a sidelong swing and had struck
the floor, reducing a plank to splinters. There it
turned, wobbled about and slammed up and down,
smashing everything that came in its way.</p>

<p>“Do something, men!” shouted Martin Hardy,
head machinist of the auto works.</p>

<p>As he spoke Mr. Hardy started on a run for the
rear of the machine shop, but he was anticipated.
His son, Ben Hardy, had arrived on the scene just
in time to take part in the thrilling event of the
moment.</p>

<p>It was after school hours, and Ben always had
free run of the plant. His father was an expert in
his line and an old and valued employee, and his son,
with his cheerful, accommodating ways, was always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
a welcome visitor with the workmen, with whom
he was a general favorite.</p>

<p>Ben was familiar with every turn and corner of
the shop. In a flash his eye took in the unusual
situation as it presented itself. He guessed out the
cause of the commotion intuitively.</p>

<p>“Don’t go, father!” he cried, seizing his father’s
arm and detaining him. “I know the way.”</p>

<p>Ben did, indeed, know the way. A sliding iron
door separated the engine room from the machine
shop. Above it was an open space, and through this
the steam was pouring. Ben knew that it was many
chances against one that the iron door was caught
on the other side. Besides this, the wobbling shaft
piece was still threshing about, a formidable barrier,
although the power was dying down as the connecting
dismantled shafts revolved less rapidly.</p>

<p>In a far corner of the machine shop there was a
sashless window frame. Through it Ben had clambered
many a time. It was used for ventilation. It
opened upon the roof of a small brick oven which
was used to bake the sand cores used in the molding
flasks.</p>

<p>Ben leaped through the aperture and landed on
the roof in a second. Beyond it rolled the iron drum
which ground the fine charcoal for the dust bags
employed in drying the wet sand in the molding
frames. This Ben cleared at a bound.</p>

<p>He heard a timber fall in the machine shop, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
there was an ominous quaking of the staunch timbers
all over the place as his feet landed on the hard
cindered floor of the boiler room.</p>

<p>“Where is Shallock, the engineer, all this time?”
murmured Ben, and running alongside of the boiler
he discovered that the man was mysteriously missing
from his post at a critical moment.</p>

<p>Through the clouds of steam fast escaping from
the overheated boiler Ben made out the engineer.
He knew Tom Shallock well, and was not astonished
at his present condition. He knew the son
of the engineer, Dave Shallock, still better. Ben
had no reason to feel particularly friendly towards
either, but he sought honestly to save the engineer
from the loss of his position and disgrace.</p>

<p>Shallock sat huddled back in the big heavy armchair
in which he rested between spells of alternate
duty to engine and boiler. He was his own fireman,
and his chair was directly in front of the furnace
door. Ben ran at him and shook him forcibly by
the arm, with the urgent words shouted into his ear:</p>

<p>“Wake up, Mr. Shallock, there’s trouble!”</p>

<p>But the engineer simply grunted in an incoherent
way, and a half-filled bottle that had slipped from
his hand to the floor told the whole miserable story.</p>

<p>Ben darted past the helpless man and ran down
two stone steps to the engine pit. It was well
that he was a boy who noticed things and usually
kept his bearings well in mind, for he had to grope<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
his way. A thrill of gladness ran through his frame
as his hand finally rested on the valve wheel. Two
turns, and Ben drew back gasping for breath and
reeking with perspiration. The whiz of the great
driving wheel lessened, the governor slowed down
to a stop. Returning to the boiler room, Ben set
the escape valve on the boiler and knew that he had
saved the day.</p>

<p>Some men came running in from the molding
room. One of them went to the iron door and unset
its latch and rolled it open, for some one was hammering
vigorously on it on the other side. It was
Mr. Hardy.</p>

<p>“Rouse him up, quick,” spoke Ben to one of the
molders, and with a motion of his foot he kicked
the tell-tale liquor flask towards the ash pit.</p>

<p>The man laughed, winked, and with the aid of
a comrade dragged the engineer to his feet. By
this time Mr. Hardy had reached the spot. Pressing
past him, the foreman faced the blinking engineer
sternly.</p>

<p>“What’s the meaning of this?” he demanded.
“Faugh!” as he caught a whiff of the engineer’s
breath—“at the old trick again, eh?”</p>

<p>“Steam overcame me,” stammered Shallock.</p>

<p>The shop foreman turned to Ben.</p>

<p>“Did you do that?” he inquired in his sharp, crisp
way, waving his hand towards the engine.</p>

<p>“I shut off the power—yes, sir,” replied Ben.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span></p>

<p>“What was this man doing?”</p>

<p>Ben hesitated and flushed up. He did not wish
to tell on anybody, much less a person who disliked
him and would be sure to ascribe any “peaching” to
spite.</p>

<p>“You needn’t answer,” suddenly spoke the foreman,
his keen eye catching sight of the bottle, and
picking it up. “Get out of here, you,” he added
disgustedly, giving the engineer a shove towards the
door.</p>

<p>“Look here, Mr. Dunn——”</p>

<p>“You get!” reiterated the foreman.</p>

<p>Shallock began to snivel.</p>

<p>“See here, you may be sick yourself some time,”
he declared in a maudlin tone.</p>

<p>“Sick!” repeated the foreman contemptuously.</p>

<p>“I’ve run my engine two years——”</p>

<p>“It isn’t your engine any more,” observed the
foreman. “One of you men go for Pete Doty,” he
continued to the group from the molding room.
“He’s out of a job, and he can have this one if he
qualifies right. That’s all,” added Dunn, with a
peremptory wave of his hand.</p>

<p>The signal was understood promptly by all hands
to get back to their respective places. Mr. Hardy
moved over to the side of Ben. He placed a hand
on his son’s head and his eyes were full of emotion.</p>

<p>“I am proud of you, my son,” he said simply.</p>

<p>“You ain’t the only one,” broke in Dunn, brusquely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
brushing Mr. Hardy aside and catching Ben’s
arm in his iron grip. “You come with me, boy.”</p>

<p>He was a resolute hustling piece of humanity,
always doing things forcefully. With a rush he
dragged Ben into and through the machine shop.</p>

<p>“Good boy!” spoke a machinist, patting Ben on
the shoulder as he passed him.</p>

<p>“You did it grand, lad,” commended a second.</p>

<p>“Three cheers for Ben Hardy!” roared Tim Grogan,
a jolly and independent apprentice.</p>

<p>The enthusiastic cheers, given with a will, died
away as the foreman and Ben reached the office.</p>

<p>“Where’s Saxton?” demanded Dunn in his bluff
off-handed way.</p>

<p>“He went outside the building,” explained the
bookkeeper, who had suspended work and looked
anxious and flustered. “Say, is the danger over?”</p>

<p>“Oh, maybe a few shingles shaken off the roof.
I reckon Saxton went outside to see how many,” retorted
the foreman sarcastically. “Here he comes.”</p>

<p>The portly proprietor of the works at that moment
came strutting through the front doorway. He was
very consequential, now that the peril was past.</p>

<p>“Here Mr. Saxton,” spoke the foreman, “—you
know this boy?”</p>

<p>“It’s Hardy’s lad, isn’t it?” replied Jasper Saxton,
with a stare at Ben.</p>

<p>“Yes. He’s saved your shop from rattling to
pieces, that’s all,” announced the foreman bluntly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
“That pet of yours, Tom Shallock, was in liquor and
asleep at his post. If Ben here hadn’t got in action
there’d have been a long shut-down of the Saxton
Automobile Works, I can tell you, and maybe some
funerals.”</p>

<p>Saxton looked annoyed and angry at the reference
to the engineer, and slightly bored at the determined
way in which his foreman kept pushing Ben to the
front. All this embarrassed the latter, who tried
to wriggle free from the grasp of the foreman.</p>

<p>“Where is Shallock?” asked Mr. Saxton uneasily.</p>

<p>“Fired,” tersely reported the foreman.</p>

<p>“Why—I—that is——” stammered Mr. Saxton.</p>

<p>“You act as if you were afraid of that man,
Mr. Saxton,” observed the foreman bluntly. “I’ve
sent for Pete Doty. He’ll be here directly. About
this boy, now——”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” nodded Mr. Saxton hurriedly. “Good
boy. First-class father, too. Shake hands. Glad.
Thank you.”</p>

<p>“Hold on, Mr. Saxton,” interrupted the foreman,
as his employer started to close the incident by entering
the office of the works. “What are you going
to do for young Hardy?”</p>

<p>“Do—eh. Ah. I see. Come into the office,
Hardy.”</p>

<p>Ben obeyed the order. Mr. Saxton looked nettled,
and Ben felt dreadfully conscious. The former
put his hands in a pocket and drew out a roll of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
bills. These he promptly transferred to another
pocket. He next fished out a dollar, glanced at it,
then at Ben, went over to a desk, drew out a money
draw and changed the large silver coin.</p>

<p>He pocketed three quarters and handed the other
twenty-five cent piece to Ben.</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” dissented Ben, drawing back. “There
is no need of that, Mr. Saxton.”</p>

<p>“I insist,” said Mr. Saxton grandly. “You’ve
done quite a big thing, Hardy, and you deserve the
reward.”</p>

<p class="center">JUST IN TIME</p>


<p>“Thank you,” said Ben.</p>

<p>“Don’t mention it,” responded Jasper Saxton.</p>

<p>The manufacturer turned from Ben with a decided
expression of relief on his face. He acted
like a man who had got off cheaply.</p>

<p>It was in Ben’s mind to ask Mr. Saxton if he
“was to keep all of the twenty-five cents,” but sarcasm
was not Ben’s forte. He was too ingenious
to cherish resentment against either friend or enemy.
Ben simply pocketed the coin. He concealed a
smile of comicality. The situation, displaying Jasper
Saxton’s usual meanness, rather tickled him.</p>

<p>He was about to turn and leave the office when
an extraordinary movement on the part of Saxton
enchained his attention. The latter with something
between a growl and a yell had described an active
jump. He landed up against a parcel bench on
which lay a variety of small machine parts, bagged
and ready for shipment.</p>

<p>“What! hasn’t that gone yet?” he shouted, his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
hand closing over a small steel section of some machine
weighing about ten pounds.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear me!” exclaimed the bookkeeper, “I was
just going to wrap that up and send it when the shop
began to shake. I’ll attend to it immediately, sir.”</p>

<p>“Immediately!” howled Saxton, as the bookkeeper
fumbled over twine and wrapping paper—“why,
it’s special. Do you understand that? The man it
is for is expecting it at the depot. He is to leave
on the five o’clock train, and it’s—seven minutes of
five now!” yelled the manufacturer, glancing at his
watch. “Here, wrap it quick, and send the office boy
kiting with it fast as you can.”</p>

<p>“Dan has gone for the mail, sir,” said the office
man.</p>

<p>“Then hustle with it yourself,” ordered Saxton.</p>

<p>“You forget that I am lame,” submitted the bookkeeper
reproachfully.</p>

<p>“It’s got to go,” stormed the manufacturer.
“Hold on, there.”</p>

<p>He shouted these last words at Ben just as the
latter was about to leave the office.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir!” said Ben inquiringly.</p>

<p>“I’ve paid you that money, you know—you’ll do
a little extra job, hey?”</p>

<p>“With pleasure,” answered Ben, with his usual
bright accommodating smile.</p>

<p>“That’s a good boy,” said Mr. Saxton. “Hustle,
now,” to his bookkeeper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>

<p>Ben stood awaiting the package from the nervous
fingers of the office employee. He was more amused
than disappointed in the narrow view Mr. Saxton
took of things in general. The quarter of a dollar
and the “extra job,” as he designated it, were characteristic
of the tight-fisted manufacturer. His treatment
of Ben had been of a piece awarded Mr. Hardy,
and Ben was not much surprised.</p>

<p>The Saxton Automobile Works was doing a large
and growing business, but it was not his own business
ability, as the self-centered manufacturer imagined,
that had brought about all this progress and
prosperity. Mr. Hardy had designed the Estrelle
auto. The Saxton Company never gave him credit
for this. Ben’s father was more of an inventor than
a business man, and he had never protected himself
as a shrewder man might have done.</p>

<p>He was a valuable workman in the Saxton service
and received very good pay. Ben, however, had
always thought that his father should have been
given more credit and money that he really got.</p>

<p>Ben’s mother had often talked to her husband
about this. Finally Mr. Hardy had gone to Mr. Saxton
and had put the case before him. Nearly all the
new and popular points about the Estrelle machine
were inventions of Mr. Hardy. Jasper Saxton did
not deny this, but he proposed that the patents be
taken out in his own name. In an indefinite way he
agreed to make some kind of an equitable settlement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
with his employer as soon as the rush season was
over. Mr. Hardy asked for a memorandum of the
agreement.</p>

<p>To this Mr. Saxton reluctantly consented after a
great deal of delay. Mr. Hardy placed the precious
document in his coat pocket. When he went back
to work he hung up his coat in its usual place.
When he got home that night the written agreement
was missing.</p>

<p>An unavailing search was made for the document.
Then in a day or two Mr. Hardy went back to his
employer and related the circumstances, asking for
a new copy of the agreement.</p>

<p>Mr. Saxton put him off on the pretext of being
very busy. Then, when urged by Mrs. Hardy and
Ben, the head machinist again approached Jasper
Saxton, the latter told him that if he would wait
till the active selling season was over and he could
get at his books, they would go together to a lawyer
and have a contract drawn up in due legal form.</p>

<p>Mr. Hardy was easily satisfied and rested content
with this promise. His heart was in his work. When
Ben intimated that he was dealing with a man with
a general reputation for business slipperiness, his
father told him that it would come out all right. He
was sanguine that Mr. Saxton would do the liberal
thing by him as soon as the selling season was over.</p>

<p>“Here you are,” said the bookkeeper, at last completing
the packing of the steel fittings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p>“Where am I to deliver it?” inquired Ben, accepting
the parcel.</p>

<p>“Name’s on the bag,” explained Jasper Saxton
hurriedly.</p>

<p>Ben glanced at the bag and read the name: “John
R. Davis.”</p>

<p>“All right,” he said. “Will he be at the depot?”</p>

<p>“He is leaving for Blairville on the five o’clock
train,” said Jasper Saxton. “You’ll know him when
you see him—large, tall man with a full beard, and
wears gold eye glasses.”</p>

<p>“I will find him if he’s there,” said Ben confidently.</p>

<p>“Don’t delay, boy,” broke in the manufacturer,
“you’ve got barely five minutes.”</p>

<p>Ben placed the parcel under his arm and passed
from the office. He made a bee-line for the front
door, to be interrupted by a shout.</p>

<p>“Hey there, Hardy!”</p>

<p>“I’m in a desperate hurry, Mr. Dunn,” said Ben,
recognizing his challenger.</p>

<p>“Never mind—only a moment.” The big foreman
got to Ben’s side and gripped his arm. “What
did he give you?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“It isn’t fair to tell,” declared Ben, with an evasive
smile.</p>

<p>“You’ll tell me,” firmly insisted the foreman.</p>

<p>“Well then—twenty-five.”</p>

<p>“H’m! He gave the night watchman only ten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
dollars when he saved the shop from burning
down. Twenty-five dollars? That’s pretty fair—for
Saxton.”</p>

<p>“Don’t delay me, Mr. Dunn,” again pleaded Ben,
tugging to get loose.</p>

<p>“Just one more question,” said the foreman.</p>

<p>“Be quick, then.”</p>

<p>“Which do you like best—open face or hunting
case watch?”</p>

<p>“Eh?” exclaimed Ben, with a start.</p>

<p>“They’ve started a little appreciation list back
there. Come, which is it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Dunn!”</p>

<p>“Decide, or we’ll buy you both,” declared Ben’s
determined captor.</p>

<p>“Any boy would like an open faced watch,” said
Ben.</p>

<p>“All right, you can go now,” said Dunn, with a
chuckle.</p>

<p>Ben darted off on a sprint to make up for lost
time. It was four blocks to the depot, and he had
about three minutes to make it in. As he darted
through the front doorway of the works Ben heard
the first starting bell ringing out at the depot.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to hustle to make it!” he declared. “No,
it can’t be done. I know what I’ll do—I’ll cut
across the triangle.”</p>

<p>Ben figured that this short cut across a dumping
yard would land him up to the train before it got<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
going at full speed. His calculations, however, were
somewhat at fault. As he neared the tracks the
train came down the rails at a pretty good rate of
speed.</p>

<p>Ben waited till the baggage car and one passenger
coach had passed him. Then, hampered by his bundle,
he gave it a fling and landed it on the platform
of the second coach.</p>

<p>Poising for a spring and a catch, Ben made a
grab for the railing of the last car.</p>

<p>Then he gripped firmly at its outer edge. With
a wrench he was pulled from the ground, but clung
sturdily, his feet flying out in the air like streamers.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>“I’VE MADE IT!” PANTED BEN HARDY.</p></div>
</div>

<p>“I’ve made it!” panted Ben Hardy, with a swing
landing both feet safely on the platform of the last
car of the speeding train.</p>

<p>“Now to find my man,” he added, pausing a
moment or two to catch his breath and then entering
the coach.</p>

<p>Ben had the name of the man well in mind to
whom he was to deliver the machine parts. He also
recalled the vague description given of the man by
Mr. Saxton. The lad glanced casually at the occupants
of the seats on each side of the coach as he
proceeded down the aisle of the car.</p>

<p>No tall bearded man with eye glasses showed up,
and gaining the front platform of the coach Ben
took up the package where it had landed and entered
the next car.</p>

<p>“Fare, there,” pronounced the conductor of the
train, confronting him.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said Ben with a smile, resting his package
on a radiator and producing the quarter Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
Saxton had given him. “Ought to keep it to frame
as a souvenir, I suppose,” added Ben to himself
comically, “but it happens to be all the money I’ve
got. First stop, conductor—the junction, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go that far. Take fifteen cents out of that,”
directed Ben, producing the reward coin.</p>

<p>“It’s twenty-five cents if you don’t have a ticket,”
announced the conductor, “ten cents extra, that’s the
rule.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” said Ben with a wry grimace.</p>

<p>“You’d ought to have thought of that,” suggested
the conductor.</p>

<p>“I didn’t have much time to think of anything
except getting aboard this train double quick,” answered
Ben. “You don’t happen to know a gentleman
named Mr. Davis, do you, conductor?”</p>

<p>The fare collector shook his head in dissent and
proceeded on his round of duty to the rear coach.
Ben took up his package again and began to scan the
passengers beyond him.</p>

<p>“That twenty-five cent piece ought to have turned
out counterfeit to carry out the fun of the thing,”
smiled Ben. “There’s a likely prospect—I think it is
my man,” added the youth, fixing his eyes upon a
person occupying a double seat near the front of the
coach.</p>

<p>This individual had a heavy beard, was tall and
athletic, wore eye glasses, and was acting excited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
and nervous. He would glance from his car window
and then ahead and back in the coach, and half arose
as if to go in search of a train official to ask some
important question.</p>

<p>As Ben approached the seats he occupied, he
noticed a book of mechanical drawings lying open
against the front cushions. Also leaning against the
seat were several quite long parcels. The ends of
these showed what Ben took to be rods or bars. The
man was certainly in the mechanical line, Ben
reasoned, and he advanced without hesitation.</p>

<p>“Is this Mr. Davis?” he inquired politely.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s me,” responded the other, turning
quickly and fixing an eager glance on his questioner.</p>

<p>“Glad to have found you,” said Ben. “I am from
the Saxton Automobile Works, and this is for you.”</p>

<p>Mr. Davis was so glad to receive the machine part
that he took it from Ben’s hands and held it under
his own arm as if it were some precious treasure.</p>

<p>“Good for you!” he exclaimed heartily, a pleasant
smile chasing away the anxiety on his face. “I was
worrying over it, I tell you. I simply had to have it
to-day. Here, sit down. I fancy you’ve been doing
some fast running, eh?”</p>

<p>“A little,” rejoined Ben with a laugh. “It was
jolly, though. You see, a fellow likes to beat a hard
task just for practice once in a while.”</p>

<p>Ben sank to a seat greatly enjoying the relief from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
a severe strain. His companion looked at him with
interest and remarked:</p>

<p>“I was afraid that part wasn’t going to reach me.
Thought it was strange, too, for I had been very
explicit in my directions. I told the Saxton people
to spare no expense so I got it in time. As it was
a sort of test as to what you folks could do and
meant lots of work for your shop in the future, I
counted on the right work on time.”</p>

<p>The speaker unpacked the part. Ben knew something
about machinery, and observed that it was a
double eccentric with several complicated attachments.
He recognized it as a class of work always
given into his father’s expert hands. It was exquisitely
turned, jointed and polished.</p>

<p>“Neat as the works of a watch, eh?” said Mr.
Davis admiringly. “That’s what I call fine work.”</p>

<p>“My father always does fine work,” said Ben,
with a tinge of pride.</p>

<p>“Oh, your father had a hand in this, did he?”
questioned Mr. Davis.</p>

<p>“I think so—yes, I am sure of it,” answered Ben,
inspecting the part. “I remember him mentioning it
as something outside of the usual run, and wondering
what it was to be used for.”</p>

<p>“It is a part of the machinery of my new airship,”
explained Mr. Davis.</p>

<p>“Oh, say, is that it?” ejaculated Ben with great
animation, and his eyes wandering to the open book<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
on the seat before him, he scanned with interest the
outlines of an aeroplane.</p>

<p>“Pleases you, does it?” interrogated his companion.</p>

<p>“Immensely,” acknowledged Ben. “My father is
the head mechanic at the Saxton works, and he is
an inventor, too. He has got up any number of new
improvements on the Estrelle car.”</p>

<p>“I would like to know him,” said Mr. Davis. “I
am glad to know you. Let me see, what is your
name?”</p>

<p>“Hardy—Ben Hardy.”</p>

<p>“Do you work at the Saxton plant, too, Ben?”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” answered Ben, “but I spend a good deal
of my spare time there. Father works there, you see,
and I like machinery.”</p>

<p>“How did you come to bring the machine part to
me?”</p>

<p>“I happened to be around, and there was no one
else to send at the time. The reason it was delayed
was that the engine at the works went wild.”</p>

<p>“Is that so? Tell me about it.”</p>

<p>Ben had not calculated on a casual remark leading
to a particular explanation. Before he was aware
of it he had pretty nearly recited the whole story of
the belt mishap at the Saxton shop.</p>

<p>“They ought to do something pretty fine for you,
those people,” suggested Mr. Davis. “I am certainly
very much obliged to you for your share in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
getting this machine part to me. I suppose some
day you will go to work at the Saxton plant?”</p>

<p>“I am making drafting a special study,” replied
Ben, “and I would like to start in at the model desk
in the pattern rooms after school is over.”</p>

<p>“Do you follow after your father in the invention
line, Ben?” asked Mr. Davis seriously.</p>

<p>“I would like to,” answered Ben. “I hardly think
it is in me, though, Mr. Davis. I once got up a perpetual
motion machine.”</p>

<p>Mr. Davis smiled, so did Ben.</p>

<p>“Yes,” nodded the latter gaily, “it perpetuated
until I had to start it again. The only practical
thing I ever did was a whistle which I made out of
a simple piece of tin.”</p>

<p>“Patented it, did you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, no,” explained Ben. “I made it for a
friend of mine. He could warble on it like a mocking
bird. I never saw anybody else who could,
though. There was a certain knack about it that he
could get, it seemed. Can I look over that book, Mr.
Davis?”</p>

<p>Ben was soon immersed in the drawings before
him. His companion seemed greatly pleased at his
interest in them. Once or twice, too, he took occasion
to commend Ben for some comment or suggestion
he made concerning the models.</p>

<p>“Why,” he said as they came to the last drawing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
of a superb machine, “you seem to have done some
digging in the aeroplane line.”</p>

<p>“Oh, all I know is second hand,” declared Ben.
“My father believes that the coming motor is the
aeroplane, and has done some experimenting in that
line. I have taken a great delight in watching him
and helping him. I will have to leave the train in a
few minutes, Mr. Davis,” he added. “There is the
whistle for the junction now, and I will have to get
back to Woodville.”</p>

<p>“Two things, Ben,” said Mr. Davis as he rose
from the seat. “It is a big thing for me to get that
machine part on time. Here is something for your
trouble,” and he handed out a folded bank note.</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” dissented Ben, arising quickly.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” insisted Mr. Davis. “Here’s the
second thing,” and he pressed a card into Ben’s hand
after writing something on its back. “I want you
to ask your father to let you come down to the big
aero meet at Blairville next week. That card will
admit you anywhere about the grounds. I shall be
in great evidence there, to speak modestly,” smiled
Mr. Davis, “and I will take pleasure in showing you
some things that will set that active head of yours
buzzing for a spell.”</p>

<p>Ben’s eyes glowed over the welcome invitation.</p>

<p>“I don’t know anything that would give me more
pleasure than to see those airships go up,” said the
youth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>

<p>“Be sure to come—I shall expect you,” declared
Mr. Davis, shaking hands warmly.</p>

<p>“Here’s luck!” exclaimed Ben, as he alighted on
the junction platform, ran across it, and got aboard
a train just starting in an opposite direction for
Woodville, the conductor of which he knew very
well, and who had the privilege of passing friends
short distances.</p>

<p>He had calculated on a two-hours’ wait at the
junction, and here was the afternoon accommodation
train, twenty minutes late, but just in time to start
him homeward bound without a minute’s delay.</p>

<p>Ben reached Woodville and went up to the automobile
works at once. It lacked half an hour of
quitting time, and he decided he had better report
the safe delivery of the machine part at the office.
Besides that, he would have a chance to walk home
with his father.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s you?” observed Mr. Saxton, as he entered
the office.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied Ben.</p>

<p>“Did you deliver the parcel to Mr. Davis?”</p>

<p>“I did, Mr. Saxton. I managed to just catch the
train on the fly.”</p>

<p>“How was that?”</p>

<p>Ben explained.</p>

<p>“Then you had to go clear to the junction?”</p>

<p>“Or jump off,” smiled Ben.</p>

<p>“H’m—cost you fifteen cents, then?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>

<p>“No, sir, a quarter. You see there’s an extra
ten cents when you do not buy your ticket in advance.”</p>

<p>“H’m!” again commented the manufacturer.
“You ought to get back that rebate. Here, Smith,”
to the bookkeeper, “give Hardy twenty-five cents.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” dissented Ben, and Saxton brightened
up magically. “Mr. Davis insisted on giving me
five dollars.”</p>

<p>“He did, eh?” spoke Jasper Saxton thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. He was very glad to get the machine
part, and insisted on paying me for what he called
my trouble.”</p>

<p>“Very good. Glad. That is—h’m—you see—quite
right, Hardy.”</p>

<p>At first Ben fancied that Jasper Saxton was going
to suggest that he divide up the five dollars with the
company. However, Mr. Saxton dismissed him
with a wave of the hand and Ben went in search of
his father.</p>

<p>He recited his recent experience, showed him the
five-dollar bill with some pride in his face, and told
his father he would wait till quitting time and go
home with him.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid we’ll have to change that programme,
Ben,” advised Mr. Hardy.</p>

<p>“How is that, father?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Saxton wants the engine overhauled and
that shaft reset, and I will have to put in a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
hours extra time, so I shall not go home till later.”</p>

<p>“What about supper, father?” inquired Ben.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll pick up something at a restaurant.”</p>

<p>“Mother will insist on sending something to you,
I know,” prophesied Ben.</p>

<p>“Well, I won’t say that home cooking wouldn’t
suit me best,” confessed Mr. Hardy.</p>

<p>Ben started from the shop, when Caleb Dunn
hailed him with the words:</p>

<p>“Hold on there, young man.”</p>

<p>“All right,” responded Ben, smiling.</p>

<p>The foreman gained Ben’s side. He drew a shop-soiled
sheet of paper from the pocket of his working
blouse.</p>

<p>“Every man in the shop,” he announced.</p>

<p>“Every man what?” queried Ben.</p>

<p>“Name signed to the document.”</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“Subscription.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Ben, guessing and flushing.</p>

<p>“Understand, do you?” demanded the iron fisted,
warm hearted foreman with a grim chuckle.
“Testimonial—Watch—Open face—Solid gold—Get
out.”</p>

<p>He gave Ben a shove and shook his fist playfully
at him, and the boy went on his way laughing and
feeling joyful.</p>

<p>Ben had to tell the story of the day’s experience
all over again when he reached home. His mother<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
said little, as between the lines she read the noble
impulses that had actuated the good son of a good
father in striving to do his duty and be of benefit
to others. She kissed him fondly, however, and her
eyes were moist and loving as after supper he started
for the works with the basket of food she had
prepared for Mr. Hardy.</p>

<p>Ben found the works closed down and his father
overhauling some tools, ready to set at work when
the foreman, who lived near by, returned from his
supper. Mr. Hardy said that they would finish their
work by about ten o’clock.</p>

<p>“Let me come up about nine o’clock and watch
around, father, and go home with you,” suggested
Ben.</p>

<p>“I am always glad of your company, my son,”
said Mr. Hardy.</p>

<p>“All right, I’ll be here,” said Ben.</p>

<p>He did not go directly home. It was a pleasant
evening, and Ben leisurely strolled about the downtown
streets, taking in the sights of the liveliest
hour of the day among the stores.</p>

<p>“Hello!” he said, quickening his steps as he
caught the sound of music, and following its source
he noticed a crowd gathered about a corner curb.</p>

<p>As Ben neared the group he discovered a street
piano mounted on wheels, being operated by a man.
Standing by him was his partner. The latter had
a piece of tin between his lips. Keeping in tune with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
the hurdy gurdy, he was producing beautiful liquid
notes that rang out clear and musical as the soaring
notes of a lark.</p>

<p>The crowd was enchanted. The music was novel
and harmonious. The whistle gave out notes as
clear and pure as those of a flute.</p>

<p>The tune ended. Ben Hardy watched the whistler
remove the piece of tin from between his lips. As
he did so Ben started forward, his eyes fixed upon
the little device intently.</p>

<p>“Why!” exclaimed Ben in profound astonishment,
“that is the very whistle I invented for Bob
Dallow.”</p>

<p class="center">THE “SYBILLINE” WHISTLE</p>


<p>The whistle he had invented and the name Bob
Dallow instantly carried back the mind of Ben
to what he looked upon as the pleasantest part of
his young life.</p>

<p>About six months previous to the opening of this
story Bob Dallow had put in an appearance at the
Hardy home. Neither Ben nor his parents had ever
seen him before, but the homeless orphan boy had
received a hearty welcome.</p>

<p>It appeared that he was the son of a half sister
of Mrs. Hardy, and he had come into the Hardy
household in such a lively, manly fashion that he
had won all their hearts at once.</p>

<p>“Just looking up my scattered relations as I hop
about the world, Aunt Mary,” he had announced to
Mrs. Hardy. “Here to-day and there to-morrow.
I won’t bother you more than this afternoon and
to-night. It makes a fellow feel he’s got something
to tie to, you know, when he gets lonely, so I thought
I would drop in on you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p>Bob had been an orphan for two years. Thrown
on his own resources, he had gone to work on the
first job that offered with a smile, and left it for
another one with a hurrah. He fascinated Ben with
the happy, good-natured way in which he took the
ups and downs of business life.</p>

<p>“Every regular job I get,” declared Bob, airily,
“there was a separate and distinct hoodoo about it.
For instance, the first man I worked for was a
groceryman. He confidentially instructed me on
his short weight tactics one night and I left the next
morning. My second employer was a clothier. He
insisted on paying off my first month’s salary in a
suit damaged by fire and water and four sizes too
big for me, so I left him and became a clerk in a
dry goods store. My boss there nearly starved me
and made me sleep on a box under a stairway. I
pined for fresh air and took to the road.”</p>

<p>Bob explained that “taking to the road” meant
for him, first, a ticket collector for a side show at a
circus, next, a brief career at driving a band wagon,
and lastly as a chauffeur.</p>

<p>“I am now pretty good at handling a machine,”
he declared, “and am on my way to a new job for a
crack automobile man who makes a specialty of
racing for prizes.”</p>

<p>Bob brought a rather exciting atmosphere into
the quiet Hardy home, but it did not harm any. He
succeeded in stirring up some new ideas in the active<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
mind of Ben, but the latter, his folks knew, loved
home life too fondly to ever become a confirmed
rover. Then, too, Bob was a boy of excellent principles.
There was no bravado or recklessness about
his exuberant spirits. He was manly and always
seeing the bright side of things, adventurous and
undaunted by trivial disappointments.</p>

<p>“I’ll make it some day—in a big way. I feel it
in my bones,” he insisted hopefully.</p>

<p>“I hope you do,” replied Ben.</p>

<p>“So will you,” declared Bob, enthusiastically, the
next day, when, in showing his guest about his little
work room at home, Ben brought to light a whistle
he had invented. It consisted of a bent circle of
tin. This was perforated on one side, and this in
connection with a peculiar shaping of the outer lip
of the device enabled a person to give out a shrill call
that could be heard fully a mile distant on a quiet
day.</p>

<p>Ben had distributed freely samples of his handicraft
among his boy chums, and on picnic occasions
the woods would ring with what his comrades called
a bird call. The modest young inventor noticed,
however, that most of the users of the whistles
never got much beyond a commonplace squeak,
while the shrill efforts of the adepts scared the birds
away instead of attracting them.</p>

<p>Bob Dallow put a new phase on the affair. His
twenty-four hours’ visit expanded and was encouraged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
to five days. The last afternoon of his stay,
when Ben came home from school he was somewhat
excitedly invited by his popular chum to accompany
him to the garden.</p>

<p>“See her,” said Bob, “—or rather, listen.”</p>

<p>Bob placed the whistle between his lips. He began
a tune, carried it through, and finished it with a
flush of triumph.</p>

<p>“I declare!” exclaimed the delighted Ben, lost in
admiration of his friend’s splendid efforts. “I never
heard better music.”</p>

<p>Patience and practice had enabled Bob to become
a master of the little device.</p>

<p>“It’s a big thing,” he insisted, “and if I were you
I’d have it patented. I won’t say that anybody can
play it—not everybody can play a cornet, either.
You’ve got to cultivate what they call the horn lip
to do that. You’ll find lots that can do it, though.
I am one of them. ‘Home, Sweet Home’ with variations,
listen.”</p>

<p>“Why, Bob,” exclaimed Mrs. Hardy, whom the
boys found standing near by quite enraptured with
the fine performance of her young guest.</p>

<p>Bob influenced Ben to make him a dozen of the
little whistles. When he left the Hardys the next
morning with many happy thanks for their kindness
to him, his words to Ben were:</p>

<p>“I am going to make some money out of that
whistle—see if I don’t.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p>The prediction had somewhat faded out of Ben’s
mind after the departure of their lively visitor.
Bob wrote to him only once, telling him that he was
enjoying life as a chauffeur for a liberal employer.
For over two months, however, no word had come
from the roving boy. As to the whistle, Ben had
nearly forgotten about that. Now the subject came
up to his mind in quite a forcible way on the public
streets of Woodville.</p>

<p>Ben was following the impulse to go forward
and request the whistler to let him have a look at
the device he used to render such melliferous sounds,
when the man at the piano stepped in front of the
instrument.</p>

<p>He drew open the flaps of a little satchel swung
from his shoulder, revealing a number of tin
whistles.</p>

<p>“The Sybilline whistle, gentlemen,” he announced
in broken English. He was apparently of the better
class of foreign street musicians. “This ees not a
toy. It ees a musical instrument. We don’t say
all ones can play as does these professore at my
sides. But practeese he make perfects. Only ten
cents, gentlemen.”</p>

<p>The man with the whistle gave out a vivid and
rapid series of thrills, tremolos and bird imitations.
A number of purchasers handed up their dimes, Ben
among them. Then he retired to one side and
closely inspected the whistle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, his heart beating a trifle faster
with pleasure and pride, “it is the same, it is my
invention.”</p>

<p>Ben went up to the whistler, who had now ceased
playing and was strolling to one side while his partner
continued his appeals for purchasers in the
crowd.</p>

<p>“Mister,” asked Ben, extending his bought whistle,
“where do you get these.”</p>

<p>“The Sybilline—yes,” politely answered the man
addressed. “At the city, my friend.”</p>

<p>“Where in the city?” pressed Ben.</p>

<p>“At the Central.”</p>

<p>“And what is the Central?”</p>

<p>“It is the headquarters—it is the padrone who
hires us.”</p>

<p>“What is his name?”</p>

<p>“It is Vladimir—he has many, many men who
work for him. It is percentages.”</p>

<p>“I understand,” murmured Ben, drawing back.
“This doesn’t connect up Bob Dallow, though. Maybe
some one else struck the same whistle idea I did.”</p>

<p>As Ben reached home he craned his neck, and then
hurried his steps with a low cry of surprise and delight.
There was a light in the dining-room, and
seated at the table enjoying a hastily prepared meal,
and waited on by Mrs. Hardy, was the very boy
so strongly in his thoughts at the present moment—Bob
Dallow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>“Well, well, well!” cried Ben, rushing unceremoniously
into the room and greeting the smiling Bob,
with handshakes and slaps on the shoulder, “here’s
a grand sight for sore eyes.”</p>

<p>“Glad to see me, are you?” chuckled Bob, with
his usual tantalizing imperturbability.</p>

<p>“That’s what.”</p>

<p>“You’ll be gladder soon. Let a famished pilgrim
enjoy the rarest cookery in the country first, will
you?”</p>

<p>“Say, you’re looking pretty prosperous, it seems
to me, Bob,” said Ben, scrutinizing his chum closely
as he reseated himself at the table.</p>

<p>“Think so?” smiled Bob.</p>

<p>“Yes. That’s a pretty fine suit you’re wearing.”</p>

<p>“One of my fine ones—oh, yes,” responded Bob,
coolly. “Now then,” taking a last sup of tea, “thank
you, Mrs. Hardy—and thank you, Ben.”</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“That whistle idea of yours.”</p>

<p>“Eh?” exclaimed Ben with a start, instantly coupling
the musical team downtown with the appearance
of his friend.</p>

<p>“You see, I stopped over about the dividends,”
explained Bob.</p>

<p>“Dividends?” repeated Ben, wonderingly.</p>

<p>“That’s the business proposition, exactly,” replied
Bob, with an affected grand air. “That whistle of
yours—well, the results first. See that?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>

<p>Very grandly Bob drew out a folding pocketbook
and placed it open on the table. Elastic bands held
a little heap of new green banknotes on either flap.</p>

<p>“Four hundred dollars,” announced Bob, with an
expansive chuckle and a grin.</p>

<p>“Where did you get it,” stammered Ben.</p>

<p>“Your whistle.”</p>

<p>“You’re joking, Bob.”</p>

<p>“Not at all. There it is, the benefits of your little
invention—four hundred dollars, half yours.”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS</p>


<p>Ben stared in a stupefied way at the money, then
at the smiling face of his friend, and then at his
mother.</p>

<p>“You’re joking, Bob,” he said.</p>

<p>“Does that money look like a joke?” demanded
Bob Dallow. “Here, that’s your share, two hundred
dollars. Count it, and then I’ll tell you how
this little fortune came to travel down to Woodville
with me.”</p>

<p>Bob removed the banknotes from one flap of the
pocketbook and pushed them across the table to
Ben. The latter merely fumbled them. He was
fairly stunned at the sensational actions of his relative.</p>

<p>“It’s all along of that whistle of yours, just as I
said,” declared Bob. “When I left here two months
ago it was to take a job as chauffeur, you remember.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” nodded Ben.</p>

<p>“It was an easy job and a paying one, so easy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
that I began to get fat and lazy. The man I worked
for had a lot of sporty friends, and they got to be
such wild company I concluded to strike out for
something better. I got word of a nice family at
Springfield wanting a chauffeur. When I got there
I found the place filled. I hadn’t much ready cash
in my pocket. I’d made fine wages, but I spent it
laying in a good stock of clothes. At the end of the
week I was pretty near at the end of my rope financially.
One evening I was consoling myself driving
away the blues with some cheerful tunes on one of
your whistles, when a big idea struck me.”</p>

<p>“About the whistle?” inquired Ben.</p>

<p>“Just that. When I began outlining plans for
making my fortune out of the little device, so many
ideas came to me that I began to think I was a
natural born promoter. Well, the next morning I
swept away all the dreamy schemes from the proposition
and went to work in a sensible business-like
way.”</p>

<p>“What did you do, Bob?”</p>

<p>“I knew a young lawyer in Springfield, and I was
sure he would give me his opinion free gratis. He
did. After he had heard my story, and had inspected
the whistle, and had looked up what he called
authorities on the subject, he told me he didn’t believe
a patent on the whistle would hold water.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” commented Ben.</p>

<p>“Even if it would, he said the whistle, being a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
mere passing novelty, would soon peg out. He advised
me to find somebody who would take the whole
business off my hands for a bulk sum—some one
who ran a sort of supply headquarters for cheap
novelties. That started me on a new tangent. I
finally ran across the ideal person—a sort of padrone
fellow who hired poor foreigners on a commission.
I went to him fully prepared though.”</p>

<p>“How was that Bob?” asked Ben.</p>

<p>“Why, I knew he or somebody else would steal
the whistle idea if it struck them favorably, unless
I made a tangible show of controlling the situation.
I made a real impressive looking drawing of the
whistle—sectional view and all that, you know.
Then I went to a big hardware factory and got a
written estimate on the whistle in ten thousand lots.”</p>

<p>“Whew!” ejaculated Ben admiringly.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m no cheap man when I get started,”
vaunted Bob, with a laugh. “The name of the padrone
was Vladimir. When I went to him, I had
the drawing and the contract and a lot of big talk
all ready. The man was interested at once. He
heard me play on the whistle, tried it himself, didn’t
make much progress, and then shook his head dubiously.
Then he called in half a dozen fellows. They
were musicians in his employ—mostly hurdy-gurdy
men. They all tried the whistle. Four of them got
onto the knack at once. Then I made my star hit.”</p>

<p>“How was that?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>

<p>“I suggested that he send out a team—organ and
whistle—and tab results. The thing went grandly.
The next morning, after a lot of dickering, Vladimir
gave me four hundred dollars for the outfit.”</p>

<p>“Bob, you are a genius,” remarked Mrs. Hardy.</p>

<p>“Does the price suit you, Mr. Inventor?” inquired
the other, “or did I sell too cheap?”</p>

<p>“Cheap!” cried Ben. “Think of it! All that
money mine! What will I ever do with it?”</p>

<p>“Why, invest it in a new invention, of course,”
cried Bob. “Make it your working capital, and get
out something finer and finer till you rival Edison.”</p>

<p>“You’re poking fun at me,” declared Ben. “The
whistle was a mere trifle, and an accident. I may
know how to handle a few machine tools, but I’m
no real inventor, Bob Dallow. Of course——”</p>

<p>Ben paused abruptly. His eyes sparkled as a sudden
idea came to him. Quick-witted Bob eyed him
keenly. “Go ahead, Ben,” he ordered, “of course
what?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I was just thinking some foolishness,” answered
Ben, with a conscious flush.</p>

<p>“What foolishness?” persisted Bob.</p>

<p>“Well then, airships.”</p>

<p>“Eh—what’s that?” demanded Bob.</p>

<p>“Why, Ben!” murmured his mother.</p>

<p>“What put airships in your head?” pressed Bob,
with a token of real curiosity and interest in manner
and voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span></p>

<p>“Well, I saw a man to-day who set me wild over
them,” confessed Ben bluntly. “He is a real airship
man himself. He had a book on airships full of
drawings, and he has invited me to the airship meet
at Blairville next week.”</p>

<p>Bob Dallow stared hard at Ben as the latter spoke
this outburst.</p>

<p>“Well, well,” he said slowly, but forcibly, “you’ve
got them, haven’t you? So have I. Invited to the
meet at Blairville? Why, that’s where I’ve got
my new job.”</p>

<p>“You have?” exclaimed Ben.</p>

<p>“Yes. Don’t look as if we’ve both gone dreaming,
Aunt Mary,” said Bob to his hostess, with a
merry laugh, “I’m hit, too. Tell you, I’ve figured
out a system. I’ve made up my mind to keep up
with the procession as it passes along. The automobile
was a good stunt while it was fresh. Too
common for enterprising fellows now, though. It’s
all the new fad—airships. I’m headed for it strong.
Yes, I’ve got a chance for work at Blairville, and
I’m to report for duty to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“What’s your airship man’s name, Bob?” inquired
Ben.</p>

<p>“John Davis.”</p>

<p>“Why, that’s the name of my friend, too,” exclaimed
Ben animatedly. “Say, isn’t this a queer
coincidence?”</p>

<p>Ben handed his money to his mother to keep for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
him. Then there was a regular “powwow” between
the two boys. For nearly an hour there was a constant
chorus of such words as aeroplanes, monoplanes,
high speeders, air cars, aerials, aeratoriums,
ultra violet rays, upper air mains, barographs and
other technical terms, most of them proceeding from
Bob, who it seemed had studied up aeronautics, and
had acquired a smart smattering of aerial science
in general. Then incidentally the conversation reverted
back to the whistle, and Ben alluded to the
two musicians he had seen playing near the public
square.</p>

<p>“That starts me,” declared Bob, springing to his
feet. “They are two of Vladimir’s men, and I have
a curiosity to find out how they are doing with the
Sybilline.”</p>

<p>The two friends went out to the street together.
Two squares traversed they separated, Bob, to hunt
for the street musicians, Ben to go to the automobile
works to join his father.</p>

<p>“You will come back to the house, of course,
Bob?” asked Ben.</p>

<p>“I should say I would—if I am invited.”</p>

<p>“You don’t have to be,” declared Ben. “It’s
welcome home to you whenever you strike Woodville.
Father and I will be home some time within
an hour, I think.”</p>

<p>“All right, Ben.”</p>

<p>Bob proceeded towards the business portion of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
the town. Ben struck off in the direction of the
Saxton shops.</p>

<p>He whistled cheerily as he went along, for he felt
pretty exuberant. The stirring events of the day,
winding up with the remarkable arrival of his favorite
chum, made him happy. The airship feature
kept him dreaming, and Ben was overexcited and
buoyant.</p>

<p>As he turned a corner he came upon two boys near
a street lamp. One was sitting in the shadow of a
tree on a fence post. The other Ben recognized as
the son of the engineer of the automobile works discharged
that day.</p>

<p>“Good evening,” hailed Ben pleasantly.</p>

<p>The lad addressed bestowed a fearful scowl on
him.</p>

<p>“I didn’t speak to you,” he muttered.</p>

<p>Ben passed on. He knew the sullen, quarrelsome
nature of Dave Shallock quite well. The latter was
a bully. Once he had gone too far with his domineering
tactics with Ben, and a necessary and unavoidable
mixup had resulted, which had taught
Dave to keep his place.</p>

<p>“I suppose he feels bad over his father losing his
job,” reflected Ben sympathizingly. “I know I
should, if our positions were changed.”</p>

<p>Presently our hero turned quickly at the sound
of footsteps behind him. It was to come face to
face with the subject of his thoughts. Dave Shallock’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
eyes had a wicked glare. His hands were
clenched, and Ben prepared for an onslaught, but
he asked quietly:</p>

<p>“Want to see me, Dave?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do,” retorted Dave, in a husky, rage-filled
voice. “I said a minute ago I didn’t speak to you.
Well, I’m speaking to you now, you hear me! and
I’ve got something to say you won’t soon forget.”</p>

<p>“What is it about?” inquired Ben.</p>

<p>“It’s about your mean, miserable trick in getting
my father discharged from the Saxton Automobile
Works!” shouted Dave Shallock wrathfully.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">THE AIRSHIP IDEA</p>


<p>Ben backed to the fence. He was not a bit afraid
of Dave Shallock, but he was fully aware of his
tricky nature. He got into a position where he
could be sure that Dave’s ally, the fellow he had
noticed on the fence, did not get a chance to attack
him unawares, side or rear.</p>

<p>The boy seated on the fence did not move, however,
and Dave himself did not press Ben closely.
The latter decided that his adversary had learned
his lesson in past encounters, and was simply bent
on giving him a tongue lashing.</p>

<p>“Haven’t you made a mistake, Dave?” suggested
Ben.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, certainly!” shouted Dave in sarcastic
tones, “I only dreamed that your father has been
waiting for weeks to shove Pete Doty, his particular
friend and crony, into my father’s job.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Doty is no more my father’s particular
friend than is any honest deserving man,” declared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
Ben. “Certainly my father never suggested his
name as the successor of your father.”</p>

<p>“Tell that to the greenies!” vociferated the furious
Dave. “It was all a nice little plot—your jumping
in where you had no business, and exposing
dad.”</p>

<p>“If somebody hadn’t stepped in,” said Ben, “you
mightn’t have any father now.”</p>

<p>“Oh, is that so,” sneered Dave. “I guess my
father knows how to run his department without
your help. He’s been at it long enough.”</p>

<p>“He wasn’t able to run it to-day, Dave,” declared
Ben. “He was ‘asleep at the switch,’ as the saying
goes, and I tried to rouse him and keep things quiet.”</p>

<p>“Yah! Looks like it, when you let on that he’d
been drinking.”</p>

<p>“I? Never!” cried Ben indignantly. “On the contrary,
I tried to shield him, and I don’t know that
I had any right to do so, either. Why, I even tried
to hide the tell-tale bottle in the ashes.”</p>

<p>“That’s the way you tell it,” interrupted Dave
contemptuously. “All right. I just wanted to have
the satisfaction of telling you that you and your
father will rue the day you stuck your noses into
our family’s business.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry for your father, Dave.”</p>

<p>“Bah! you can spare your pity. Maybe you’ll
need it yourselves, you and your father. Wait till
the tables turn.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>

<p>“All right,” said Ben simply. “You are wrong
in your guesses, though, as to our having any ill
will against your people.”</p>

<p>“I guess my father has a pull—huh! I guess so,”
blurted out Dave, as Ben started to leave the spot.
“He wouldn’t take back his job working about that
dirty boiler and that greasy old engine, if they
offered him double what he got. I’d have you know
that my father is as good a master mechanic as
yours is, any day.”</p>

<p>“I’ve heard that he’s a fine all-round machinist,”
acknowledged Ben. “I would like to see him get
right up to the top.”</p>

<p>“He’ll get there. Mark you, Ben Hardy, he’s
after your father’s scalp, and he’s going to get it.”</p>

<p>“Fair play, and the best man wins,” answered our
hero briefly.</p>

<p>“There’s more than that,” shouted Dave down the
street after Ben. “My father could just set your
father on his pegs. Will he do it? Nix! That’s
going to be his revenge. Ha! ha! Old Saxton has
bamboozled your father, and my father can produce
the evidence——”</p>

<p>“Shut up, you chump!” growled the boy on the
fence, jumping to the ground and rushing at Dave
and silencing him. “Do you want to give the whole
snap away?”</p>

<p>Ben recognized the boy now as he came within<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
the radius of the street lamp. He was a cousin of
Dave named Dick Farrell, who lived in another
town.</p>

<p>“H’m,” commented Ben, as he proceeded on his
way, “was that all brag and bluster, or is there
something under all this?”</p>

<p>Ben recalled the remark of Dunn to Saxton that
afternoon, when the bluff machine shop foreman
had told the manufacturer that he acted as if he
were afraid of Tom Shallock. He remembered, too,
that it was general knowledge about the works that
Shallock had been discharged for cause more times
than any man in the place, and had always managed
to get back again into the employment.</p>

<p>“Dave said, too, that Saxton was bamboozling
father,” reflected Ben. “Well, I have always
thought that myself. I wonder, though, what he
means when he talks about his father producing
the evidence?”</p>

<p>Ben reached the automobile works figuring out all
kinds of suspicions and solutions as to the threatening
remark of Dave Shallock. His father and
Foreman Dunn had just concluded their labors. Mr.
Hardy washed up, and was soon on his way home,
Ben chattering exuberantly by his side.</p>

<p>Ben, at his father’s request, recited the vivid occurrences
of the day. He went into detail about his
talk with Mr. Davis, and mentioned the invitation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
to the aero meet. Mr. Hardy said nothing as to his
prospects of going there, but Ben knew that was his
way, always turning a proposition over fully in his
mind before he came to a final decision, and the son
was hopeful.</p>

<p>“Two hundred dollars?” repeated Mr. Hardy in
great surprise, as Ben told about the money Bob
Dallow had brought him. “That is a small fortune
for a boy like you.”</p>

<p>“Father, what did Dave Shallock mean by the
threat he made?” asked Ben, quite anxiously, when
the conversation had taken a new turn.</p>

<p>“Oh, some boastful nonsense,” said Mr. Hardy
indifferently. “I have no time to analyze such talk.
Tom Shallock would be a fair workman if he would
keep sober. It is certainly true that he has some
influence with Mr. Saxton, but he cannot injure us.
I shall keep right on doing my best, and honest labor
will always command a fair market. As to you,
Ben, a very pretty and useful token of regard the
men are getting for you will show how they esteem
you.”</p>

<p>Ben tried a hint or two to induce his father to
take some action about the patents that he had given
under the control of Jasper Saxton, but Mr. Hardy
was not responsive.</p>

<p>“Father is pretty tired, I suppose,” reflected the
youth, “but, all the same, I am going to get mother<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
to urge him up to some action on that patent business.
Delays are dangerous, and I haven’t much
confidence in Mr. Saxton.”</p>

<p>Bob Dallow greeted them as they reached home.
Mr. Hardy went into the house, where his wife had
a special lunch spread for him.</p>

<p>“Well, Bob, what about the whistle?” inquired
Ben.</p>

<p>“Going fine,” declared Bob. “We made a big
mistake, though.”</p>

<p>“How is that?”</p>

<p>“Sold it too cheap. That Vladimir seems to be
coining money out of it.”</p>

<p>“Well, I am satisfied,” said Ben.</p>

<p>The conversation drifted to airships before the
two boys had been together five minutes. The enthusiastic
Bob declared that he was going to make a
big record in the new field he was about to enter so
ardently. He predicted that if Ben would study up
aeronautics and put his inventive ability to work,
he would make a grand success.</p>

<p>“You overrate me,” said Ben modestly. “At all
events, though, I would like to go to the aero meet
next week.”</p>

<p>“We’ll have one fine time, if you do,” returned
Bob. “I’ll write you as soon as I get fixed in my
new position. In the meantime, let us bring up the
subject to your father and see what he thinks about
it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Hardy listened with an indulgent smile to
the plans and suggestions of their young guest.</p>

<p>“I haven’t the heart to refuse you any reasonable
request after your fine record of to-day, Ben,” he
told his son, “but I want to take a night’s sleep over
this.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that will be best,” remarked Mrs. Hardy.</p>

<p>Bob was obliged to be content with this decision.
Ben was sure he would be allowed to go to the aero
meet. As to any encouragement as to experimenting
on a machine of his own, which was a glowing ideal
in his mind, he was not so certain.</p>

<p>He regarded his father with anxious expectation
as Mr. Hardy left the breakfast table next morning.
As was usual they all went out on the porch, where
Mr. Hardy generally rested and chatted a few
minutes before starting for the automobile works.</p>

<p>“Well, Ben,” he said with a pleasant smile, as they
became comfortably seated, “I’ve thought over this
new idea which I see Bob has been so industriously
cultivating in your mind.”</p>

<p>“Blame me, that’s right, Mr. Hardy!” spoke up
Bob airily. “I’ll bet you, though, that something
tangible comes out of it.”</p>

<p>“Your vacation begins next week, Ben,” resumed
Mr. Hardy. “You have quite a little capital of
your own. You can employ some of it, if you think
it wise, in looking up this new idea, and I don’t
mind helping you a bit on experiments.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span></p>

<p>“Thank you, father,” said Ben joyfully.</p>

<p>“Only don’t let all your common sense and practical
ideas go up in an airship that won’t sail,” was
Mr. Hardy’s final advice.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">MYSTERY</p>


<p>“Hurrah—I’m coming!”</p>

<p>Ben Hardy began a brief but enthusiastic letter
to his friend, Bob Dallow, with these words.</p>

<p>“It is all settled, Bob,” added Ben, “and if you
are sure you won’t be put out by having me share
your quarters, I can stay for the whole week. We
will have a glorious time, and I am just wild to see
those airship stunts you describe.”</p>

<p>School had closed for the long vacation on Thursday.
It was now the following Monday, and Ben
had his satchel packed and was counting the hours
until Tuesday morning and train time should arrive.</p>

<p>Ben had calculated to devote the long vacation to
work in the Saxton automobile plant. The pattern
shop was a favorite spot with him in his visits to
the great factory. He was an adept at drawing,
and the foreman of the model department had given
him some encouragement as to a future position.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
He had, however, advised Ben to wait a year or two
and stick to his studies.</p>

<p>Mr. Hardy had done some serious thinking, and
had given his son the result of the same. Ben’s
success with the whistle, his evident liking for machinery,
particularly of new types, had caused Mr.
Hardy to recall his own early dreams and longings
before he became a master machinist.</p>

<p>What pleased the father most was the way Ben
went at aeronautics. The evening after Bob Dallow
left Woodville, Mr. Hardy came home to find Ben
seated before a stand piled high with reading matter,
and deeply absorbed in a big volume from the town
library.</p>

<p>“Airships, Ben?” inquired his father with an indulgent
smile.</p>

<p>“One end of them,” responded Ben. “I’ve ransacked
the town for books and magazines bearing
on the subject, and as you see I have got a raft of
them. They cover mostly the history end of the
business, though. I wish I had some of the up-to-date
books Mr. Davis showed me.”</p>

<p>“What you read now will fit in all right to that
later,” remarked Mr. Hardy. “Get as familiar as
you can with your subject in a general way, Ben.
You manage the theoretical end of the business, and
when you come back from the aero meet we will
join forces on a practical demonstration of the
science.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span></p>

<p>“Will you, father?” pressed Ben eagerly.</p>

<p>“By the time you get back I will screen off a
space next to the work shed, and we will see what
we can do in making an airship,” continued Mr.
Hardy. “You have talked over the subject so much,
I am inclined to take a flier myself—not up in the
air, Ben, but in an inventive way.”</p>

<p>Ben was more filled with enthusiasm than ever
after that. He had been made doubly happy during
the week at receiving a handsome watch, bearing a
pleasing testimonial in script on its inner case, for
his bravery in saving the auto works from possible
wreck.</p>

<p>Ben was not troubled any further by Dave Shallock.
He heard that his father, the discharged engineer,
was loafing about some low drinking places
in the town. Shallock was making all kinds of foolish
boasts as to his ability to get a new and better
place from “old Saxton,” as he designated him. He
hinted at a certain powerful influence he had with
the manufacturer. So far his bragging had brought
no results.</p>

<p>That evening, just about dusk, our hero started
from home after supper for a downtown stroll.
There was a short cut across a square which had
once held a handsome residence, burned down a few
months previous.</p>

<p>The high hedge fence, broken in places, still lined
the front of the grounds. As Ben neared this he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
paused, quite startled. Some one had made a bold
rush through the hedge and crouched in a stealthy
manner on its other side, as if trying to hide.</p>

<p>“Why,” murmured Ben in some astonishment,
drawing behind a bush, “it is Tom Shallock!”</p>

<p>Ben wondered what the discharged engineer was
up to. He soon learned the motive of his sudden
rush from the public street. Almost immediately a
sharp mandatory voice beyond the hedge shouted
out:</p>

<p>“That will do, Shallock—you come out here, if
you want to save trouble.”</p>

<p>“Oh, is that you?” stammered Shallock, and he
sheepishly retraced his steps to the sidewalk.</p>

<p>“You knew it was, and you tried to sneak away
from me, didn’t you?” challenged the stormy voice.</p>

<p>Ben was curious enough to press close up to the
hedge and peer through it. Shallock stood leaning
in a shambling way outside, a crestfallen expression
on his face. The man addressing him was a very
keen-eyed fellow Ben had never seen before. He
was a stranger in Woodville. He carried a whip
in one hand, and Ben wondered why this was.</p>

<p>“Now then,” spoke the stranger, “what does this
mean? You’ve been trying to keep out of my way
for two hours, and I know it. That worthless cub
boy of yours sent me off on a false hunt.”</p>

<p>“I—I wasn’t prepared to see you,” said Shallock
shiftily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span></p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Well, then, I knew what you came after.”</p>

<p>“Yes, money.”</p>

<p>“Exactly. I had none. I know you’re a hard
man, and I hoped you’d let me alone for a few days
longer.”</p>

<p>“See here, Shallock,” spoke the other sharply,
“I’ve got just one last warning to give you. Produce
one hundred dollars, and get it quick, or I’ll
close down on you bag and baggage.”</p>

<p>Shallock began to snivel in a maudlin way. He
had been drinking, and he began to deplore his unhappy
lot. He was an unfortunate target of fate.
He had lost his job. His grocery credit had been
stopped only that day, and he had been obliged to
sell some of his wife’s jewelry to buy food for the
family.</p>

<p>“Not food, but drink for yourself, you mean,”
derided the stranger testily. “Now then, I’m tired
of waiting for that money. I loaned it to you on a
promise of repayment due months ago.”</p>

<p>“I can’t pay when I haven’t got it, can I?” demurred
Shallock.</p>

<p>“You can get money out of Jasper Saxton.”</p>

<p>“Ha! yes—yes, indeed,” spurted up Shallock
eagerly. “Say, that’s just what I’m working on.
Honestly, if you’ll consent not to trouble me for
a week, I’ll not only have the best job in the Saxton
machine shops, but a lot of ready cash besides.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t know that,” remarked the stranger.</p>

<p>“Yes, you do,” disputed Shallock. “You know
that Saxton has got to fix me out right, or lose a
fortune.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to see some of your boasted fortune right
now,” sneered the man.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s coming. Don’t press me too hard, and
make me spoil the whole business. You shall have
double interest. I’ll promise you faithfully to settle
the whole business in a month. See here, you can’t
possibly lose. Why, if I failed you, all you’ve got
to do is to take that security of mine and go to
Saxton with it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t fancy mixing up in a blackmailing game,”
observed the stranger. “Now then, Shallock, I’ll
give you a last chance. You arrange your business
so you can pay me one hundred dollars a week from
to-day, the balance by the first of the month, or I’ll
foreclose on your security.”</p>

<p>“It’s a bargain,” declared Shallock, in a tone of
hopeful relief. “Yes, sir, if I don’t carry out just
that agreement, you can take your security to old
Saxton.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” said the stranger in a deep decisive
voice, “I’ll take it to Martin Hardy.”</p>

<p>Ben was startled at this last declaration. Shallock
uttered a gasp and put out his hands pleadingly.</p>

<p>“Don’t do that,” he begged in a husky tone, “say,
don’t do that!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span></p>

<p>“You’ve heard me,” replied the stranger, turning
his back on Shallock and crossing the street. “I’ll
do just what I say if you don’t raise that money!”</p>

<p>“What does this mean?” exclaimed Ben in an excited
tone. “Here’s some dark plotting, and I’m
going to get at the bottom of this.”</p>

<p>He ran along the inside at the hedge, passed
through it at a break, and observed the stranger
just turning the corner of the side street.</p>

<p>As Ben in turn reached it, the crack of the whip
rang out. A sharp “Get up!” sent a mettled horse
attached to a light gig carrying the stranger away
in a flash. Our hero outdistanced, reluctantly admitted
to himself that for the present at least he
had lost the clew of a big mystery.</p>

<p class="center">AT THE AERO MEET</p>


<p>“Well, Ben, this is life worth living, eh?”</p>

<p>“Bob,” declared Ben enthusiastically, “it’s been
the event of my life.”</p>

<p>“And more to come. We want to make an early
start to-morrow. I’ll show you what real air sailing
is then.”</p>

<p>Ben Hardy was, indeed, having the liveliest time
in all his youthful experience. This was his third
day at Blairville, and every minute since his arrival
had been packed full of excitement and pleasure.</p>

<p>Mr. Davis had greeted him with a kindly courtesy
and attention that would win the heart of any live,
up-to-date boy. The fact that he was a relative of
Bob Dallow had added to the friendly interest of
the aviator. Bob, to use a popular phrase, had
made good. He had taken to practical aeronautics
like a duck to water.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp45" id="p060" style="max-width: 69.4375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/p060.jpg" alt="">
  <div class="caption"><p>IT WAS THE FIRST TIME HE HAD SEEN A
REAL AIRSHIP AFLOAT.</p></div>
</div>

<p>One week of practice under the direction of the
skilled man-bird, Mr. Davis, had proven that Bob
was going to become as good an aviator as he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>was an accomplished chauffeur. Mr. Davis had
comfortable living quarters in a building on the
aviation field. Ben was invited to double up with
Bob, and they made a happy and a merry team.</p>

<p>The first day had been a bewildering experience of
delight and astonishment for Ben. It was an occasion
of experiment and preparation for trial flights
on the morrow. Bob in his lively way had become
a general favorite with the various aeronauts on
the field. He and Ben had free entrance to every
tent and aero hangar in the enclosure. After a
while Ben’s interest grew into studious attention,
and that evening he pored industriously over the
technical aviation literature of which Mr. Davis had
a surfeit.</p>

<p>The aviator was more than pleased at the real interest
displayed by his willing protégé. Bob Dallow
had gratified him with his cool daring and quick
adaptation to his new calling. In Ben, however, the
old aviator discovered more of the scientific and constructive
element. He was kindly disposed, and he
seemed decided to give Ben all the encouragement
he could.</p>

<p>The second day was fairly spectacular for our
hero. It was the first time he had seen a real airship
afloat. He had already mastered the mechanism
of the aeroplane. Their ready manipulation by the
aviators, however, fairly fascinated him.</p>

<p>It was a famous sight to see a venturesome air<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
sailor start a daring altitude record in the teeth of
a wind blowing twenty miles an hour. It was like
a dream to watch a machine diminish to a mere
speck in the air, and then in a roundabout gyration
through several complete circles, wind up in a sensational
glide back to its starting place.</p>

<p>Some of the bird-men went so far and so high
that they stiffly climbed from their machines as they
regained <em>terra firma</em>. One monoplane ventured some
practicable curves, dashed into a fence and was
demolished. There were many triumphs, but some
mishaps as well. Ben stored a mass of valuable
ideas in his mind that stirring day in his new experience.</p>

<p>Mr. Davis gave the boys a ride in his monoplane,
the <em>Flyer</em>, the day following. It was Ben’s first
flight. He went through all the thrills of an initial
ascent, but was charmed after the first breathless
rush aloft in the subsequent cavortings of the light
and dainty fabric of wood and canvas.</p>

<p>The present aero meet was simply preliminary to
a contest occasion for prizes two weeks later. A
convention at a near city was to intervene. Until the
last of the month the enclosed field would be simply
a practice campus. On the coming Saturday, however,
there were to be some endurance tests which
would go far towards deciding the selection of the
best aeroplane on the grounds.</p>

<p>Ben had arranged to wait and see this event.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
Then he was to return home. He had freely confessed
to Mr. Davis that he intended to go into
building an airship of his own.</p>

<p>It was Wednesday evening when Ben and Bob
were discussing “the early start to-morrow.” Both
were looking forward to the ensuing morning to an
event in which they were especially interested. It
was to be a free-for-all occasion. Bob had persuaded
Mr. Davis to allow them to use the <em>Flyer</em>,
in fact Bob and Ben had made several experimental
flights that afternoon. It had ended in Ben making
a suggestion which set his impulsive chum on fire
with expectancy and enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“Keep it to yourself, Ben,” directed Bob, as they
went to their quarters for the night. “We’ll show
these aviator-fellows some fancy work and a novelty
feature or two.”</p>

<p>“It will be quite a novelty, I think, yes,” said Ben.
“Don’t be too venturesome, though, Bob.”</p>

<p>“It’s the only way to attract attention and get
even a look in at the prize aero meet,” declared
Bob. “I’m a candidate all right, if they’ll give me a
show.”</p>

<p>Ben made a mysterious visit to town late in the
afternoon. He returned in a wagon, the driver of
which was directed to deliver a mysterious load at
an old unused shed at an unfrequented part of the
grounds.</p>

<p>Five o’clock the next morning found Ben and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
Bob arrived at this shed in sprightly mood. Hauling
two long light packages outside of the structure,
they proceeded to unpack them. They brought to
light over two dozen cardboard boxes about a foot
square. They had no covers, and Ben next brought
from the shed a bundle of sticks about five feet long.</p>

<p>“Now then,” said Bob, “got the hammer and
tacks?”</p>

<p>“Full supply, Bob,” replied Ben cheerily.</p>

<p>“All right, you sharpen one end of the sticks,
and I’ll tack the box on to the end of them.”</p>

<p>In less than a half an hour the boys had the boxes
open depth upwards mounted on the sticks.</p>

<p>“Now then, to place them,” suggested Ben. “This
part of the field isn’t used much, and we can cover
all the space we want.”</p>

<p>They proceeded to set the sticks in the ground at
regular intervals, covering a space over one half a
mile in length and extending two hundred yards
from the fence.</p>

<p>“For all the world they look like a lot of bird
boxes on a ranch,” observed Bob. “Just about the
right distance apart.”</p>

<p>“Won’t somebody disturb them?” inquired Ben.</p>

<p>“Why should anyone do that? Of course this
queer layout will attract attention. No one will
meddle with our little stations, though, for they will
know they must be an equipment for some new
experiments.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span></p>

<p>The night watchman came forward to meet the
boys as Ben emerged from the shed, a bag slung
across his shoulders.</p>

<p>The officer leaned perplexedly on his cane and
stood staring wonderingly at the singular outlay
of boxes.</p>

<p>“Hello, Mr. Brown,” hailed Bob heartily.
“Thought you had gone home, and we were stealing
a march on you.”</p>

<p>“I’m waiting to be relieved by the day man. He’s
a little late on duty,” explained the watchman.
“What’s those boxes?”</p>

<p>“Oh, a big new idea, Mr. Brown,” declared Bob,
with a mysterious air.</p>

<p>“No mischief, I hope?”</p>

<p>“Mischief?” repeated Bob with great gravity.
“I should say not. If Ben and I don’t tumble out
of the airship, those boxes will comprise a very
original and remarkable experiment in the aviation
line.”</p>

<p>“That so?” muttered the watchman in a puzzled
way.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. Say, Mr. Brown, won’t you speak to
the day man and have him keep a sort of watch
over the boxes here, so that nobody meddles with
them?”</p>

<p>“I will, if you’ll tell me what you’re up to along
with them.”</p>

<p>“That’s a bargain—listen,” said Bob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span></p>

<p>“Aha!” exclaimed the watchman, as Bob whispered
in his ear. “Well, you are two originals, and
no mistake! I’ll tell my partner.”</p>

<p>“And keep it a secret until the event comes off?”</p>

<p>“Oh, sure—but what will he tell the fellows who
will be snooking around here wanting to know what
it all means?”</p>

<p>“Why,” said Bob, “just say—stunts.”</p>

<p>“But they will want to know what kind of stunts.”</p>

<p>“All right,” replied Bob Dallow airily, “tell them
we’re going to make some bomb dropping experiments.”</p>

<p class="center">A BOMB-DROPPING EVENT</p>


<p>“I say, Davis, have you got anything to do with
that queer layout yonder?”</p>

<p>“Dallow and Hardy have, I think.”</p>

<p>“What’s the stunt?”</p>

<p>“You’ll have to ask them.”</p>

<p>The questioner was named Burr Rollins, and he
was the one aviator on the field for whom neither
Mr. Davis, Bob nor Ben, nor in fact anybody else
at the meet, had much use.</p>

<p>The only merit about the man was that he was
unquestionably a fair aeronaut. He had a small, but
good machine, and he knew how to handle it. He
was surly, suspicious, and on occasions an ugly customer,
quick to resent fancied wrong, and harboring
resentment in a vicious and sometimes dangerous
way when any one crossed his path.</p>

<p>He considered John Davis to be the big stumbling
block in his career. This was because the old aviator,
through his cool, courageous ways generally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
discounted his brilliant but erratic flights with a
coherent record.</p>

<p>“Rollins hates me because I have beaten him in
the test flights,” Mr. Davis had observed to Ben and
Bob one day. “He is afraid of me, though, because
he knows I am right. I am holding him up to a
fair, square-dealing programme. He doesn’t altogether
like that, for he is a resourceful man, and
full of slippery tricks. I’ve made him respect me,
though, and some day he may learn to drop those
grouches of his and act like a civilized being.”</p>

<p>“That helper of his, the young fellow he calls
Dick, is about as gruff a customer as you meet,”
Bob had observed. “Ever run up against him,
Ben?”</p>

<p>“No, I have noticed him practicing at a distance,
and thought he did pretty well.”</p>

<p>“There he goes now.”</p>

<p>“Eh, that boy?” exclaimed Ben, with a stare.
“Oh, I know him by sight. Why that is Dick Farrell.
He’s a cousin of Dave Shallock.”</p>

<p>“You mean the fellow you had some trouble with,
the son of the engineer who was discharged from
the Saxton Automobile Works.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” assented Ben, with a lively memory of the
fellow on the fence the night he had last met Dave
Shallock.</p>

<p>“You told me about him,” said Bob. “Look out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
for this fellow, if he’s like that ill-natured cousin of
his.”</p>

<p>Now, just as the various bird-men about the field
were preparing for practice ascents and stunts, Rollins,
after his unsatisfactory query from Mr. Davis,
stood glumly watching Ben and Bob who had got
aboard the machine.</p>

<p>“Let her go!” shouted Ben, and Mr. Davis lent
a hand in sending the wheels spinning, and then at
the end of a little run the <em>Flyer</em> made a graceful
lateral soar, and struck a fair equilibrium about two
hundred and fifty feet from the ground.</p>

<p>Bob was strapped to the operator’s seat, hands,
feet and eyes doing just the right thing at the right
moment. Ben sat three feet behind him, slightly to
one side. The machine was constructed to accommodate
several passengers and was delicately framed
as to nicety of balance.</p>

<p>“Got the bag all right, Ben?” shot back Bob, as
the monoplane, after describing a dizzying circle
that made Ben hold his breath, turned its planes upward
and shot into the air to a still higher level.</p>

<p>“Right in my lap.”</p>

<p>“Have it ready.”</p>

<p>“There goes the opening gun for the beginning of
the endurance tests on the spiral trials.”</p>

<p>“We’ll do our own stunt on that after the crowd
get through,” advised Bob. “We’ll just do a bit of
floating for the present.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span></p>

<p>Ben had never been so happy and elated in his life.
It was a glorious experience, that of the ensuing
sixty minutes. The atmosphere was just right for
safe sailing. There were no sudden gusts of air,
no strong cross currents. Bob kept the <em>Flyer</em> on a
course of magnificent long sweeps, several times circling
the aviation field.</p>

<p>Thus it was easy for both boys to become comfortable
spectators of what was going on, surveying
the various airships in all their spectacular manoeuvres
from a superior height.</p>

<p>“A regular private box party, aren’t we?”
chuckled Bob.</p>

<p>“It’s wonderful,” assented his entranced companion.
“There goes the <em>Torpedo</em>.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and that Dick Farrell is aboard.”</p>

<p>“He knows how to whiz.”</p>

<p>“Whew! That’s about all he does know. H’m!
that was a narrow graze,” commented Bob, as the
<em>Torpedo</em> nearly collided with a scudding biplane.
“Some day that fellow will meet his Waterloo.”</p>

<p>After a spell the air began to clear of the exhibitors
and their machines.</p>

<p>“Now we’ll give Mr. Davis a genuine thrill,” announced
Bob. “Get ready, Ben.”</p>

<p>“I’m all ready, Bob.”</p>

<p>The young aviator brought the <em>Flyer</em> directly over
the field. They were now on a one-thousand-foot
level. Bob kept the machine directly over that part<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
of the enclosure which he and Ben had plotted with
their boxes early that morning.</p>

<p>Ben opened the bag in his lap.</p>

<p>“Fire at the warships!” ordered Bob.</p>

<p>“With oranges for bombs,” added Ben, displaying
the fruit in his lap.</p>

<p>His words let out the secret of the designed exploit.
Ben in his studies on aeronautics had found
that the deepest scientific interest was evinced in the
practicability of using airships in warfare.</p>

<p>What the boys had done that morning was to
plot a space to represent the decks of warships.
Each box commanded a radius of about three hundred
feet. Bob set the motor at its swiftest, and as
to height and variation of course followed imitated
the probable cautious and expert manoeuvres of a
real war airship evading the peril of rifle or cannon
shots from a genuine enemy below.</p>

<p>Ben poised his bombs with all the accuracy and
skill he could command. It was a new and novel
exploit in which he had no practice. The constant
turnings of the monoplane were confusing, but after
the first half dozen of the experiments Ben began
to get the knack of poising and dropping the projectiles.</p>

<p>“They didn’t all go wild, I think,” he said, as the
last orange performed its mission.</p>

<p>“We’ll get below and see how you have panned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
out as to bombardment,” said Bob. “I’ll try a record
on plain aero stunts before we land, Ben.”</p>

<p>“Careful, Bob!” warned Ben, as his daring comrade
made a sensational dive.</p>

<p>“The spiral dip,” announced Bob. “Hold your
breath.”</p>

<p>“Whew!” ejaculated Ben.</p>

<p>In a whirling top-like series of gyrations, such
as Ben had seen a bicycle spin in a crack trick display,
Bob manipulated the <em>Flyer</em>. It described a
perfect spiral effect for nearly eight hundred feet.
Then with a sharp veer the machine turned its
planes and shot upwards. A second venturesome
figure eight followed. Amid a tremendous ovation
from the spellbound crowd, the <em>Flyer</em> struck on its
wheels, bounded, rose, dropped again, and slid one
hundred yards to a graceful stop.</p>

<p>“You’re an artist, Bob,” declared Ben enthusiastically,
as they climbed from the machine.</p>

<p>The boys proceeded over to that part of the field
where they had set the boxes. Mr. Davis was leading
a crowd along the line. Two men accompanied
him, one carrying a measuring line. The other was
making notations on a tab of paper.</p>

<p>The old aviator waved his hand at his young
assistants in a cheering fashion as they reached the
last box.</p>

<p>“Well, boys, you did finely in your bomb-dropping
event,” he announced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span></p>

<p>“How’s that?” inquired Bob.</p>

<p>“Good enough to start a record,” was the reply.
“Eleven points out of a possible twenty-five. You’ll
have a column or two in the newspapers for
this exploit, Ben Hardy. If I do as well as that myself,
Saturday, I’m in for first mention at the convention,
sure.”</p>

<p class="center">A RUSH ORDER</p>


<p>“I’d like to find the man that did that!” stormed
John Davis in great rage.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t a man—it was a boy,” said Ben, but
he distinctly said it to himself.</p>

<p>There was trouble at the <em>Flyer</em> camp. It had just
been discovered. That morning Mr. Davis had
joined in the principal feats of the preliminary aviation
meet.</p>

<p>It had been a real endurance test and the barograph
record was one of the principal features of
the event. The <em>Torpedo</em> did very well as to speed,
but was lacking in the altitude test. When the barographs
were removed from the various machines the
<em>Flyer</em> showed a 6,211-foot record. The <em>Torpedo</em>
was fourth down in the list.</p>

<p>There never was a glummer, more sullen man
than Burr Rollins when the announcement was
made. It was pretty conclusive that the <em>Flyer</em>
would go into the convention the favorite entry for
the coming big aero meet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span></p>

<p>“There’s Saturday left,” growled Rollins, as he
turned his back on his fellow aviators in a wrathful
way.</p>

<p>“I’ll beat the <em>Torpedo</em> there, too,” declared Mr.
Davis confidently. “It can run like a whitehead on
a straight course, but bungles at the turns. You
lads want to keep in trim. There’s no saying what
the <em>Flyer</em> may not want of you at the big event.”</p>

<p>Now to sanguine enthusiasm there had come a
sudden dampener that had made Ben look blank
and Bob gruesome with anxiety. Mr. Davis, ordinarily
cheerful and even tempered, went all to
pieces.</p>

<p>About four o’clock in the afternoon, after the
encouraging victories of the day, the old aviator
had decided to visit the hangar that housed the
<em>Flyer</em>, to look over the machine and oil up and adjust
the machinery for the last trial of the meet.
A startling discovery greeted the aeronaut and his
two young friends.</p>

<p>One of the great claims of the <em>Flyer</em> was that it
had a double mechanism to the steering apparatus,
that admitted of unusually prompt and efficient
manipulation in case of striking a sudden change
in the air currents. Mr. Davis with a good deal of
pride claimed to be responsible for the adaptation—he
did not call it an invention.</p>

<p>This essential and precious part of the mechanism
of the <em>Flyer</em> was found unlocked from its bearings.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
Its inner rim of babbitt metal had been chiselled
out of place, and the main part of the device
had been broken squarely in two as if from the blows
of a sledge hammer.</p>

<p>“It’s easy to guess why this was done,” remarked
Bob Dallow hotly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” assented Mr. Davis, pale and excited,
“this is foul play, the work of an enemy.”</p>

<p>He glanced at the boys in turn in a significant
way, but did not voice his suspicions. All hands
thought instantly of Burr Rollins.</p>

<p>“Well, if we found the culprit, and convicted him
and tarred and feathered him into the bargain and
drove him out of the camp and the profession, it
wouldn’t mend the <em>Flyer</em>,” observed the old aviator,
with a disconsolate look at his beloved machine.
“It’s all up for me for to-morrow’s flight, lads.”</p>

<p>“Don’t say that, Mr. Davis!” cried Bob, almost
at the point of tears. “Surely it can be repaired.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know how,” dissented the aviator. “That
fixing was made from a special model. It took a
week to make it, and the mechanic who assisted me
in its construction is five hundred miles away.”</p>

<p>“Let me look at it, please,” suggested Ben, and he
went over the broken parts of the device critically.</p>

<p>“Mr. Davis,” he said, “I don’t want to hold out
any false hopes, but if anything can be done towards
fixing this I know the way.”</p>

<p>“You think it can be repaired?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span></p>

<p>“Or replaced—yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Within twelve hours?” pressed the aviator anxiously.
“Remember, time is the main point in this
difficulty.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know that,” assented Ben, studying the
device. “I think my father can help you out.”</p>

<p>“But the place where he works will be shut down
by the time you reach Woodville.”</p>

<p>“You had better let me try what I can do, Mr.
Davis,” said Ben.</p>

<p>“If you can replace that joint, Ben,” said the
aviator, “I will stand any expense and never forget
the favor.”</p>

<p>“It shall not cost you a cent, and it will make
me a happy boy if I can get back in time with the
article.”</p>

<p>Mr. Davis consulted a timetable. He looked
disappointed.</p>

<p>“No train moving Woodville way for four
hours,” he reported.</p>

<p>“Oh, I can fix that,” declared Ben.</p>

<p>He wrapped up the pieces of the broken part and
stowed them in two parcels in his pockets. Then
he said:</p>

<p>“I will be back by eight o’clock in the morning,
Mr. Davis, or send you a telegram.”</p>

<p>“You’ll be back,” predicted Bob Dallow animatedly.
“You’re starting out right to make a go
of it, I can see that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span></p>

<p>“Come on, Bob,” directed Ben. “Don’t worry,
Mr. Davis. Everything shall be done that can be
done.”</p>

<p>“I believe that, Ben,” said the aviator warmly.</p>

<p>“What’s the programme?” inquired Bob, as Ben
led the way from the Davis camp over to a neighboring
one.</p>

<p>“I am going to ask that friendly young fellow
of Barton’s to loan me his motor-cycle.”</p>

<p>“Grand idea!” applauded Bob. “He’s an accommodating
boy, and will be glad to help you through.”</p>

<p>Ten minutes later Ben was chug—chugging his
way from Blairville down a fine country road in
the direction of Woodville.</p>

<p>“I won’t tell Mr. Davis of my discovery until
after to-morrow’s event is over,” soliloquized Ben.
“I’ll have to give him a warning, though. Of course,
that ill-natured Rollins is behind this plot to disable
the <em>Flyer</em>. Dick Farrell did the work for him,
though.”</p>

<p>Ben had good reasons for this decision. Immediately
after the discovery of the disabled monoplane,
Ben had noticed a piece of paper lying under the
machine. It was all greasy and crinkled. Ben, inspecting
this, found it covered with writing. It
was a letter from Dave Shallock at Woodville to
Dick Farrell at the aero field. The latter had used
it to wipe the grease from his hands after his manipulation
of the monoplane machinery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span></p>

<p>Ben rode into the yard at home just as his father
and mother were sitting down to supper. He was
covered with dust and pretty well tired out from his
rapid run. He received a royally glad welcome,
washed up, and thoroughly enjoyed a home meal
once more.</p>

<p>“I have come to have you help me out on something,
father,” said Ben after supper.</p>

<p>“What is that, my son?” inquired Mr. Hardy.</p>

<p>Ben produced the broken parts of the monoplane
mechanism and explained the urgency of the unexpected
home visit. His father listened attentively
and closely examined the pieces of metal.</p>

<p>“Can you mend it, father?” inquired Ben anxiously.</p>

<p>“It is no easy job,” replied Mr. Hardy seriously.
“What time did you say you could give me on it?”</p>

<p>“In order to be of any use, it must be at the field
by eight o’clock to-morrow morning at the latest,”
replied Ben.</p>

<p>Mr. Hardy went for his hat and told his wife
that he and Ben might not be home until very late.</p>

<p>“If the plant was running, this might be a mere
trifle,” said Mr. Hardy, as Ben accompanied him
in the direction of the Saxton works.</p>

<p>When they arrived at the plant they found the
watchman strolling in the shop yards. A few words
from Mr. Hardy resulted in his unlocking a side
door and letting them into the machine shop. Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
Hardy went to the section where there were some
small hand lathes. He lit the gas in their vicinity
and took off his coat, putting on his working blouse.</p>

<p>As has been indicated, Mr. Hardy was a skilled
artisan. The present task, however, was one that
fully tested his mettle. Ben watched his patient,
painstaking efforts till nearly ten o’clock. He was
glad when his father required his assistance at a
small portable forge, and later at a lathe propelled by
foot and hand power.</p>

<p>“Lay down on the bench yonder, Ben,” directed
Mr. Hardy about midnight, “and take a little rest.”</p>

<p>“Can’t I help you, father?” inquired Ben.</p>

<p>“Nothing now, Ben,” replied Mr. Hardy. “It
will take me several hours to finish up this piece of
work, and you will have a long day before you.”</p>

<p>Daylight was streaming through the windows of
the machine shop when Ben opened his eyes. His
father was standing at the bench inspecting the
result of his long labors. He looked quite white
and wearied. For all that, Ben read in his face the
satisfaction of work successfully accomplished.</p>

<p>“Did you make it, father?” he inquired, springing
to his feet.</p>

<p>“Yes, Ben. I would advise, however, that Mr.
Davis have a new bearing made soon. This will
answer for a time, but it is only a patched-up make-shift.”</p>

<p>The device was bundled up. Ben accompanied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
his father home, and they had a refreshing breakfast.
Then Ben got the motor-cycle in shape for the
return trip to the aviation field.</p>

<p>“You are the best father ever lived!” declared
the boy, as he strapped the little piece of machinery
to the cycle.</p>

<p>“That’s worth something—coming from a bright,
active young fellow like you,” smiled Mr. Hardy
in reply.</p>

<p>“And the smartest man in the bargain!” added
Ben.</p>

<p>“We’ll try some of it, then, on that wonderful
monoplane you are going to build, Ben,” said his
father.</p>

<p>Ben reached the aviation grounds before eight
o’clock. He received a rousing greeting from Mr.
Davis. He had the satisfaction of seeing the <em>Flyer</em>
make its record flight of the season two hours later.</p>

<p>“Remember, Ben,” said the aviator that afternoon,
as Ben bade him good-bye and started for the
train with Bob Dallow, “you are to come to the big
meet the last of the month.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be there,” declared Ben animatedly, “and
I’ll be there with a new airship that I am going to
build myself.”</p>

<p>“Good luck to you, Ben!” encouraged the old
aviator.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">THE DART</p>


<p>“Well, Ben, how is your airship work coming
on?”</p>

<p>“Famously, father.”</p>

<p>“That’s good. Here is a drawing of the new
curve planes we talked about last night. We have
a whole afternoon before us, and I would like to
look over things.”</p>

<p>“I will be glad to have you,” declared Ben. “I
know you can make some valuable suggestions.”</p>

<p>Bright and early the Monday morning after his
return from the aero meet, Ben had set at work to
build his airship. He was not daunted by the thought
that the same was a big undertaking for a boy. Mr.
Davis told him that it was an easy thing to do, if
a person knew how to do it and started about it
right.</p>

<p>In his father Ben found a skilled and willing
helper. Mr. Hardy was slow and cautious about
entering upon any work he did not thoroughly
understand. He was more at home with automobiles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
than airships, and not inclined to move from a
groove with which he was thoroughly familiar into
one that was so far purely speculative for him. His
desire to encourage Ben, however, impelled him to
take a deep interest in the efforts of his son. Before
he had given his thoughts two days to the fascinating
new field, the expert mechanician found himself
quite as enthusiastic as his son over the proposition,
although he was not as demonstrative as
Ben.</p>

<p>A large shed on the Hardy property had always
been a home workshop for the master machinist. It
was well stored with tools, and it was here that Mr.
Hardy had produced many of his automobile inventions.
During the absence of Ben at the aero
meet, he had fenced in with a screen wire a space
over fifty feet wide adjoining the shed. Here a
scaffolding, a light lifting crane, and work horses
had been set to accommodate the worker. Ben
started in at his experimental task with all necessary
accessories for prosecuting his labors.</p>

<p>The Saturday afternoon of that week his father
had come home from work at one o’clock. He
looked and felt as brisk and lively as a boy just out
of school as he joined Ben in the work yard.</p>

<p>Ben’s airship had begun to assume definite form
and substance. The motor part of the machine did
not trouble our hero at all. He knew that appurtenance
when it was needed would be the latest and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
best devised that his father could select. The framework
of wood and canvas was what tested Ben’s
skill.</p>

<p>Mr. Hardy had helped him in making the drawings
of the machine before he had commenced work
on it. Every morning he laid out specific work for
the day and every evening he critically inspected it.</p>

<p>“Well, father,” observed Ben, after studying over
the new drawings, “the <em>Dart</em> begins to look like
something, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“The <em>Dart</em>, eh?” smiled Mr. Hardy, “so you
have chosen that name?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I thought it quite appropriate. My first
ambition is high sailing. Mr. Davis won on that,
and even the <em>Flyer</em> did not make such a very
high flight. I believe with a fair machine specially
built I can beat his record.”</p>

<p>“All right, Ben,” remarked Mr. Hardy, “we will
continue on our model. If I had foreseen how this
line of work was going to interest me, however,
and had realized the practical possibilities of the
construction, I should have recommended a larger
model.”</p>

<p>“We will try the <em>Dart</em> first. If she makes a go
of it, we can try something more ambitious.”</p>

<p>Father and son were employed in the congenial
work in a pleasant progressive way all the afternoon.
Ben had never been so happy in his life, and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>novel labor acted as a restful variation for his
father.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>“BUILDING AN AIRSHIP, ARE YOU, HARDY”</p></div>
</div>

<p>It was about five o’clock when Ben, holding a
skeleton frame on a curving slant while Mr. Hardy
covered it with canvas, chanced to glance towards
the street.</p>

<p>“Father, some one is coming,” he said in a significant
tone.</p>

<p>“Who is it, Ben?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Saxton.”</p>

<p>“Indeed,” observed Mr. Hardy. He did not discontinue
his work, but securing it so the canvas
would not give, then looked up to greet his unexpected
visitor.</p>

<p>The proprietor of the automobile works, portly,
overdressed, and swelling with a sense of his own
importance, did not look pleased or agreeable as he
approached the work yard and passed in through its
open gateway.</p>

<p>“Good afternoon, Mr. Saxton,” observed Ben,
while his father bowed courteously.</p>

<p>“H’m,” observed Jasper Saxton in a dry non-committal
tone, curiously scanning the skeleton of the
monoplane, “building an airship, are you, Hardy?”</p>

<p>“Trying to,” answered Ben’s father.</p>

<p>“Something new?”</p>

<p>“Father couldn’t make anything without striking
some improvements,” remarked Ben.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span></p>

<p>He spoke pleasantly, but all the same to give the
wealthy manufacturer a hint along the line of his
notorious indifference to the past valuable services
of his head machinist.</p>

<p>“Think there’s something to it, do you, Hardy?”
inquired Saxton.</p>

<p>“How do you mean?” asked Mr. Hardy.</p>

<p>“Well, along practical lines. Is the aviation fever
only a spurt, or is it going to be a real feature?”</p>

<p>“In the manufacturing line, you mean.” inquired
Mr. Hardy.</p>

<p>“That’s it.”</p>

<p>“Well, the Diebold people over at Martinville are
making and selling some machines. They are thinking
of stocking up with duplicate parts. There will
of course be a good deal of supply trade, even if the
thing runs only as a fad.”</p>

<p>“I hadn’t heard of that,” remarked Mr. Saxton
in a thoughtful, speculative way. “Something to
it, is there?”</p>

<p>“I think so.”</p>

<p>“Worth specializing as a department?”</p>

<p>“You would have to decide that, Mr. Saxton,”
replied Mr. Hardy. “I couldn’t venture an opinion.”</p>

<p>“You appear to think enough of it to give your
time to experimenting, it seems,” said the manufacturer.
“I don’t want to get behind in the procession,
you know. If we could work into the airship<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
business in our dull months, it might become
quite a profitable feature of the business.”</p>

<p>Mr. Saxton went all around the framework on
the wooden horses, and inspected every part of the
skeleton machine. He asked many questions. Especially
was he interested, when Mr. Hardy with the
natural eloquence of an inventor explained some
new features of the <em>Dart</em>.</p>

<p>Then the manufacturer strolled to one side in a
thoughtful way. He took out a pencil and a card
and did some figuring.</p>

<p>“See here, Hardy,” he said at length, “I’ve decided
to give this airship business a try. We’ll just
move this model down to the plant where we’ll have
everything handy, and you can put in a week or two
seeing how the proposition pans out.”</p>

<p class="center">A SERIOUS CHARGE</p>


<p>Ben had never been more astonished in his life
than he was now at the amazing words of the proprietor
of the Saxton Automobile Works. As to
Mr. Hardy, he gave a start and stared blankly at
his employer.</p>

<p>“What was that you said, sir?” he demanded, and
Ben detected a latent fire in his father’s eye that was
not usually there. Dense and thick-skinned as Jasper
Saxton was, he could not fail to realize that his
bulldozing methods had exceeded the limit in the
present instance. He failed to meet Mr. Hardy’s
fixed, challenging glance.</p>

<p>“Why—er—you see, Hardy, this thing has gone
pretty far, you know.”</p>

<p>“What thing?” demanded Mr. Hardy.</p>

<p>“This airship work.”</p>

<p>“And you expect me to turn in the <em>Dart</em> here to
your works?”</p>

<p>“That’s it, Hardy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span></p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Saxton, it can’t be done.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Because it belongs to my son here, Ben.”</p>

<p>“Rot! rubbish!” flared up Jasper Saxton, his face
getting red, his eyes exhibiting the ugly mood that
always surged to the surface when any one dared to
cross his plans. “No subterfuge, now, Hardy, no
subterfuge.”</p>

<p>“I think you have generally found me a truthful,
plain-spoken man,” said Mr. Hardy with dignity.
“This airship is the property of my son exclusively.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I’d have you know that your time and
the material you are using here are my property!”
shouted Mr. Saxton, lashing around with his cane.
“See here, Hardy, I buy your work and ability for
a price, and I’ll have no man robbing me of my just
dues. I can get you in trouble—yes, I can,” continued
the narrow-minded manufacturer recklessly.
“I’ve let you have your swing and said nothing,
but now it’s got to stop.”</p>

<p>“What has got to stop?”</p>

<p>“You used my shop one whole night, gas, machines,
material, on a side job for some pet of your
boy there up at the aero field. Oh, I know all about
it. My watchman told me.”</p>

<p>“And I told him to do so, and further, mentioned
it to your bookkeeper, and instructed him to charge
me for it, if there was any charge to make. I think,
though, it’s pretty small business, Mr. Saxton, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
a trifling accommodation like that is refused to an
old and faithful employee.”</p>

<p>“We’ll let that pass. There are other things,”
muttered Jasper Saxton. “You install my airship
department, and I’ll see that the patents are duly protected.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you certainly know how to protect patents,”
remarked Mr. Hardy meaningly. “All the same,
sir, this special machine, the <em>Dart</em>, belongs to my
son, Ben, and can’t be included in any bargain you
and I may make.”</p>

<p>“Humbug! It’s got to,” insisted the manufacturer
in his usual domineering fashion. “I don’t
want to make you trouble, Hardy—I don’t want to
be hard on you.”</p>

<p>“About what?” demanded Mr. Hardy vaguely.</p>

<p>“Oh, about a number of things. You are using
tools and materials here that belong to me.”</p>

<p>“For which I shall pay you.”</p>

<p>“You have taken the run of my shop, and some
people say that there have been a lot of parts stolen
from the plant. I know there is a lot of stuff missing.”</p>

<p>Mr. Hardy’s face took an expression that Ben
had never seen there before. He advanced straight
up to his malicious employer, his eyes blazing with
indignation and scorn.</p>

<p>“Do you mean to intimate that I am a thief?” he
demanded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span></p>

<p>“I am not saying,” observed Jasper Saxton, wilting,
but his mean soul showing in its true colors.</p>

<p>“Shame!” cried Ben, wrought up indescribably.
“Don’t do it, father!”</p>

<p>Quick as a flash Ben sprang forward to arrest
the descending arm of his father. Had he not done
so, Jasper Saxton would have measured his length
on the ground. As it was, he dodged out of the
way, white and scared.</p>

<p>“You are right, Ben,” spoke Mr. Hardy in a
husky tone, but controlling his emotion. “Mr. Saxton,
my boy has said it: Shame on you—I will thank
you to leave these premises.”</p>

<p>“Take care! take care!” growled the manufacturer
threateningly.</p>

<p>“I’ll leave your employ.”</p>

<p>“You’ll have a bill to settle first, mind that.”</p>

<p>“And you, too—a big one,” retorted Mr. Hardy,
rousing up again. “I serve you notice, sir—I shall
sue you for my inventions on the Estrelle automobile
just as soon as I can place the matter in the
hands of a lawyer.”</p>

<p>“You will, eh?” fairly howled Jasper Saxton,
becoming furious. “Try it, try it! Why, I can ruin
you. I’ll show you.”</p>

<p>“You had better go away from here,” advised
Ben, putting himself before the manufacturer to
shield his father from further insult.</p>

<p>Jasper Saxton departed, threatening and gesticulating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
furiously. Ben restrained himself from saying
some pretty bitter things. As the manufacturer
disappeared, he turned to his father with an anxious,
sorrowful face.</p>

<p>“Oh, father!” he exclaimed, “what have we
done?”</p>

<p>Mr. Hardy sighed. Then his face broke into a
smile of deep relief, as though a heavy load had
been removed from his mind, and he said:</p>

<p>“The best thing in the world, my son, and it
ought to have been done long ago.”</p>

<p>“But you have given up your position at the Saxton
plant?”</p>

<p>“Was it much of a position, Ben, with the knowledge
in my mind all the time that I was being robbed
by that man? I haven’t said much, Ben, but I have
been thinking a good deal since you told me about
the threat that Dave Shallock made.”</p>

<p>“I am glad of it, father.”</p>

<p>“Then do not worry about my prompt action. I
had intended to make a last demand on Saxton for
my rights in those patents.”</p>

<p>“It would have been no use,” declared Ben rather
gloomily.</p>

<p>“I realized that, too. His behavior just now has
only hastened my decision. Do you think any self-respecting
man could remain in Saxton’s employ
after his accusations?”</p>

<p>“But you are no thief, father.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span></p>

<p>“No one knows that better than Saxton. He was
trying to bluff and frighten me. My record is open
to the world, so his threats fall harmless. To think
of his ingratitude after you saved his plant from
destruction!”</p>

<p>“I believe that Tom Shallock has some hold on
Saxton,” said Ben. “Maybe they are in a plot together
to get you into trouble. Perhaps Saxton
thinks if he can discredit you, it will help in denying
that you had any claim on those automobile
patents.”</p>

<p>“It is unfortunate that I lost that memorandum
that he gave me. That would prove my right to
half the patents.”</p>

<p>“You mean stolen from you,” declared Ben, and
he recalled the conversation he had overheard between
Tom Shallock and the stranger who had outdistanced
him in the light gig. “Father, you remember
that man I told you about who demanded
money he had loaned to Tom Shallock?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” nodded Mr. Hardy.</p>

<p>“I should know him again. I am going to make
it my business to find that man.”</p>

<p>“What good will that do, Ben?” asked his father.</p>

<p>“I am satisfied that he could tell a whole lot about
Shallock. Maybe about that stolen contract, too.”</p>

<p>The visit of the conscienceless manufacturer had
put rather a dismal end to a pleasant afternoon for
father and son. Mr. Hardy took it quietly as was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
his wont, but his wife was much agitated when the
circumstances were related to her.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” she inquired.</p>

<p>“Well, first of all, I am going to help Ben complete
his airship—a good airship,” declared Mr.
Hardy emphatically. “The next thing I am going
to do is to place this patent litigation in the hands
of a capable lawyer. I might later go into building
air machines as a regular business for myself.
It will take time to find out if that is best. In the
meanwhile I shall apply for a position with the Diebold
Company up at Martinsville!”</p>

<p>“Why, they wanted you last year, didn’t they,
father?” asked Ben.</p>

<p>“Yes, and I feel sure they will want me now.”</p>

<p>“But that is so far from home,” suggested Mrs.
Hardy anxiously.</p>

<p>“Only three miles. I can go to and come from
my work on a bicycle, and the exercise will be the
best thing in the world for me,” declared Mr.
Hardy.</p>

<p>Ben did a good deal of hard thinking after he
went to bed. He had an uneasy feeling that some
plot was working against his father’s good name.</p>

<p>Monday morning a neighbor told Mrs. Hardy that
she had got out of bed to close a window during
the night, and had seen a man with a lantern looking
over the flying machine in the work yard. As she
let down the window the noise disturbed the night<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
prowler, and he extinguished the lantern and skulked
away.</p>

<p>Two nights later, about eleven o’clock, Ben roused
up from his sleep to find his mother shaking him
gently.</p>

<p>“Ben! Ben!” she whispered in a quick tone of
alarm, “get up at once.”</p>

<p>“What is the matter, mother?” asked Ben excitedly.</p>

<p>“A man with a bag over his shoulder just went
through the yard into the work shed,” was Mrs.
Hardy’s startling announcement.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">THE MAN IN THE GIG</p>


<p>Ben instantly thought of the mysterious visitor
reported by their neighbor a few evenings previous.
He hurriedly slipped on a few clothes and was down
the front stairs in three jumps.</p>

<p>“Be careful, Ben,” Mr. Hardy called after him,
also aroused by Mrs. Hardy, and getting ready to
join his son in a search for the intruder in the yard
below.</p>

<p>Ben unlocked the rear door and rushed out into
the yard. As he passed the back porch he grabbed
up the end of a hard wood hoe handle, broken off
short and used by Mrs. Hardy to brace the screen
door.</p>

<p>Ben’s first glance was toward his beloved flying
machine. He was immensely relieved to discover
no one near it. Apparently it had not been disturbed.
The gate of the work yard stood open, and
also the door of the work shed. With a spring Ben
pushed this door shut, slipped the heavy latch, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
standing on guard armed with the hoe handle
awaited the arrival of his father.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hardy had lit a lamp and set it in the rear
window upstairs, so that its rays might throw an illumination
over the yard. When Mr. Hardy appeared
he carried the lighted cellar lantern.</p>

<p>“Where is the trespasser, Ben?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“In there, if anywhere,” said Ben, tapping lightly
on the shed door with the end of his club. “Mother
says she saw a man go into the shed.”</p>

<p>Mr. Hardy undid the catch while Ben stood ready
for assault or defence. His father had the lantern
beyond the open doorway, and in his usual mild and
inoffensive way inquired:</p>

<p>“Is anybody there?”</p>

<p>“There doesn’t seem to be,” said Ben, peering
past his father as there was no response to the challenge.</p>

<p>Both entered the shed. They could not discover
the slightest indication that there had been any trespasser
in evidence since they had last visited the
place, earlier in the evening. Everything was in its
accustomed place. Ben took the lantern and flashed
its rays in all the remote cluttered-up corners of the
structure.</p>

<p>“A false alarm, I guess,” he reported finally.</p>

<p>“But your mother is positive that she saw a man
enter the shed,” suggested Mr. Hardy.</p>

<p>“Then it was some wandering tramp,” decided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
Ben, “and he slipped out while I was getting down
stairs. At all events, nothing appears to have been
disturbed or taken.”</p>

<p>They closed up the shed and returned to the house.
Ben drew his bed up close to the window of his
room, to command a good view of the rear yard.
He watched without results for nearly two hours
and then fell asleep.</p>

<p>“We are having quite a series of midnight alarms,”
remarked Mr. Hardy at the breakfast table the
next morning.</p>

<p>“I hope they don’t signify anything of importance,”
observed Ben. “The man with the lantern the
other night, and this latest visitor with a bag over his
shoulder, are certainly mysterious.”</p>

<p>Ben went out to the shed and looked it over
searchingly in the daylight. Nothing was missing, so
far as he could discover. As he started to return
to the house, however, he paused, stooped over and
picked up something from the floor.</p>

<p>It was an unfamiliar object about the size of a
big breastpin. It resembled a badge, for at the back
of it was a hinged pin and a snap catch to hold the
pin in place. The front of the device consisted of
a dozen criss-cross alternate threads of copper and
silver. These were of wavy formation and resembled
spider’s legs.</p>

<p>“How did this ever get here?” ruminated Ben.
“It wasn’t here yesterday afternoon, for it is too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
conspicuous to miss. Maybe our midnight visitor
with the bag dropped it.”</p>

<p>“Now then, for a good day’s work,” said Mr.
Hardy briskly, appearing on the scene.</p>

<p>“Father, do you suppose some one is trying to
get us into trouble?”</p>

<p>“Who, for instance?”</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Saxton.”</p>

<p>“Why should he? No, he will not disturb me as
long as I keep quiet about that suit on the patents.”</p>

<p>“I don’t like these mysterious night callers,” said
Ben.</p>

<p>“They haven’t done us any harm yet.”</p>

<p>“But they may. Some one did visit the work shed
last night.”</p>

<p>“How do you know that?”</p>

<p>Ben showed the strange pin he had found, and
told his suspicions.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t let these things bother you, Ben,”
advised his father sensibly. “No harm has been
done to our machine as yet. I intend to lay a wire
around the yard connected with a bell in the house,
that will alarm us if anybody comes near the work
shed.”</p>

<p>“That is a good idea,” said Ben.</p>

<p>They were so interested in their mutual work till
noon, that both for the time being forgot their suspicions
and fears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span></p>

<p>“I’ll have to ask you to do an errand for me,
Ben?” said Mr. Hardy after dinner.</p>

<p>“What is that, father?”</p>

<p>“I need some headless screws of a certain pattern.
None of the hardware stores in town keep them. I
won’t ask any favors of the Saxton people.”</p>

<p>“No, no, don’t be under any obligations to Mr.
Saxton, father.”</p>

<p>“I think you can get the screws from the Diebold
works. At any rate, you see my friend, John
Earle, the superintendent at Martinsville, and tell
him what I want. If he hasn’t got them, he can
probably tell you where you can get them.”</p>

<p>Mr. Hardy gave Ben a sample of what he wanted.
Ben started on foot for Martinsville. He reached
the Diebold plant and was received in a friendly
fashion by the superintendent. Mr. Earle asked
about his father. He drew enough out of Ben to
guess that there was some trouble at the Saxton
works. He told Ben to inform his father that he
was coming over to Woodville to see him in a day
or two.</p>

<p>“As to the screws, we haven’t got the size,” explained
the superintendent. “I am sure you can get
those at Satterly’s shop, in Auburndale. Our wagon
is going there in a few minutes, and you can ride
over.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mr. Earle,” said Ben, and ten minutes
afterward he was posted on the seat of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
factory wagon beside the driver. It was six miles
to Auburndale. Ben planned to return to Woodville
by the railroad.</p>

<p>Satterly’s was a carriage shop, and Ben found
what he wanted there. He made an inquiry as to
trains, and learned that one would pass for Woodville
in about half an hour.</p>

<p>He strolled leisurely towards the depot, the screws
in his pocket, and was turning a street corner when
a vehicle going at a good stiff pace passed him.</p>

<p>It flashed by him quickly, but not until its driver
was seen and recognized by Ben.</p>

<p>“Hello!” exclaimed Ben. “That’s the man I saw
talking with Tom Shallock in Woodville—the man
I am looking for!”</p>

<p>The next moment Ben changed his course, darting
down the street in hot pursuit of the man in
the gig.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">THE MYSTERIOUS PIN</p>


<p>“That man has got a mighty good horse,” was
Ben’s comment, as he sped down the street.</p>

<p>On the former occasion, when Ben had seen the
man in Woodville, the horse had sprinted up at a
touch. Now the animal trotted along at a still better
pace.</p>

<p>“I can never overtake him on foot,” thought our
hero, “I mustn’t lose sight of this man till I find
out who he is and where he lives.”</p>

<p>The gig was rapidly outdistancing Ben. As it
rounded a corner out of sight, the lad was wrought
up to an intense pitch of desperation.</p>

<p>Then a wild impulse sent him to the curb where
a horse attached to a light buggy was standing. Ben
made a reckless decision and acted promptly on its
suggestions.</p>

<p>The horse was not hitched. Ben reached the
buggy seat in a spring and seized lines and whip with
a vigorous:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span></p>

<p>“Get up!”</p>

<p>A yell of startled dismay rang out behind him.
Ben fancied that it came from the owner of the
horse, probably observing the theft of his rig as he
came out from some store where he had been trading.
Ben never looked back. He paid no attention
to other shouts at the rear.</p>

<p>“There he goes,” said Ben, as he turned the corner.
The gig was two squares in advance. It
turned into a new street, and our hero followed.
There were other turns, and finally the gig was halted
in front of a store. Its driver drew up to the curb,
sprang out of the gig and disappeared inside the establishment.</p>

<p>Ben drove slowly past the place. He observed that
it was a store given over to the sale of second-hand
tools. Its windows were so smoked, and grimed,
and choked up with so much miscellaneous plunder,
that he could not see the inside of the place.</p>

<p>“I’ve housed my man,” uttered Ben with satisfaction.
“He may not live here, but he certainly is
known here. That is enough for the present. Now
to return this rig.”</p>

<p>It suddenly occurred to Ben that he had acted on
a decidedly reckless impulse. He realized that it
might lead to serious results. He somewhat anxiously
urged up the horse.</p>

<p>“I must get back to the place I started from and
make an explanation,” he decided.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span></p>

<p>“Whoa!” came the stern mandate, as Ben turned
into the street where he had appropriated the rig.</p>

<p>A police officer had suddenly run out into the
street, and halting in front of the horse, waved his
arms strenuously. The animal paused and reared,
and Ben was nearly thrown from his seat.</p>

<p>“Looking for you,” remarked the officer, gazing
sternly at Ben. “Horse thief, eh?”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear no!” smiled Ben.</p>

<p>“You stole this rig.”</p>

<p>“No, I only took it—in fact, borrowed it for a
few minutes.”</p>

<p>“That don’t go down,” observed the officer.</p>

<p>“Why you find me getting back to the place
where I found the rig, quick as I can, don’t you?”
challenged Ben.</p>

<p>The officer got up into the seat and ordered Ben
to drive to the police station. Ben was annoyed,
and a trifle anxious. They had not proceeded more
than two squares, however, when they met the seeming
owner of the rig coming towards them.</p>

<p>“I’ve got him,” announced the officer.</p>

<p>“See you have,” nodded the man brusquely, looking
over the horse. “You’re a fine young jailbird,
aren’t you?” he hailed Ben.</p>

<p>“I am not what you think, mister,” declared the
boy quietly. “My name is Ben Hardy, I live at
Woodville, and everybody knows I am an honest
boy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span></p>

<p>“You haven’t shown it at Auburndale,” observed
the officer.</p>

<p>“Let me explain, please,” said Ben to the owner
of the rig. “There is a man I have been looking for
these past ten days. I ran across him here driving
a fast horse. The only way I could follow him was
by borrowing your rig.”</p>

<p>The owner of the vehicle looked Ben over critically.
Our hero did not flinch from his penetrating
glance.</p>

<p>“I came back soon as I could, as you see,” proceeded
Ben. “Now then, what’s your bill?”</p>

<p>“My bill?” repeated the man in a surprised way.</p>

<p>“Certainly. I’ve put you out and had the use of
your rig.”</p>

<p>“I guess he’s a pretty good boy. He seems to be
telling the truth,” here remarked the officer.</p>

<p>“Then I shan’t charge him a cent.”</p>

<p>“And don’t try any more such tricks,” advised
the officer. “You may not get off so easy the next
time.”</p>

<p>“You’re gentlemen, both of you,” declared Ben,
glad enough that he had escaped delay and embarrassment.</p>

<p>Our hero debated for sometime as to his wisest
course of progress. His father was in no special
hurry for the screws. The trail of the man he had
traced to the second-hand shop was fresh. Ben felt
sure that the man in the gig knew a good deal that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
might be of value to his father in his dealings with
Saxton.</p>

<p>“I’ll take another look at that store, anyhow,”
concluded Ben, and a brisk walk soon brought him
into its vicinity.</p>

<p>“The gig is gone, so the driver is probably not
in the place,” he decided.</p>

<p>Ben walked slowly past the store. He glanced in
at the open door. A rough looking, poorly dressed
man was sorting over some tools. Ben saw no one
else in the place.</p>

<p>“I’ll make a bold break,” he reflected, and entered
the store.</p>

<p>“What do you want?” demanded the apparent
proprietor of the place, turning around at the sound
of intruding footsteps.</p>

<p>“Why, I was looking for some one, mister.”</p>

<p>“Well, who is it?”</p>

<p>“A man drove up here in a gig about half an hour
ago. I want to see him.”</p>

<p>“What about?”</p>

<p>“Business.”</p>

<p>“What kind of business?” persisted the man.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell him. If you will give me his address,
I will be very much obliged to you.”</p>

<p>The man shook his head strenuously. He regarded
Ben as though he considered him an enemy
and a spy.</p>

<p>“That won’t wash,” he said, “and you had better<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
get out of here. People who have any business with
the man you are talking about, know just where to
find him, without coming snooking around here the
way you do.”</p>

<p>Ben backed away. The man looked positively
menacing now as he glared at his visitor. Ben was
shrewd enough that this place was one operated
under tactics of caution and evasiveness.</p>

<p>“Hello!” he exclaimed suddenly, and came to a
staring standstill.</p>

<p>“Hello, what?” demanded the man suspiciously,
edging between Ben and the door.</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing,” said Ben, recovering himself.</p>

<p>“Yes, there was.”</p>

<p>Ben moved from foot to foot, sizing up the situation.
The cause of his sharp ejaculation was the
discovery on his part of an odd looking pin or badge
on the lapel of the man’s coat.</p>

<p>It was an exact counterpart of the one Ben had
found in the work shed at home. Our hero reflected
rapidly. Then, without attracting the attention
of the man to what he was doing, he turned
sideways. He got the pin out of his pocket and
managed to attach it to his coat. Then he faced the
man.</p>

<p>“Aha!” exclaimed the second-hand dealer, fixing
his eyes on the pin.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">A MEAN ENEMY</p>


<p>Ben saw at once that the sight of the pin had
produced a great effect on the second-hand dealer.
He prepared to take advantage of it.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you say so at first?” inquired the
store keeper.</p>

<p>“Say what?” inquired Ben.</p>

<p>The man pointed significantly to the pin that corresponded
to the one on the lapel of his own coat.</p>

<p>“You must be one of the boys from Woodville,”
he observed.</p>

<p>“That’s where I live.”</p>

<p>“Then you know Knippel?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Ben to himself, “I’ve found out his
name, have I?” and he said aloud: “I’ve seen him
before to-day, yes.”</p>

<p>“What do you want to see him for?” inquired
the man curiously. “Say, see here, if you’ve got
something to sell, you know it’s all one dealing with
me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span></p>

<p>“All right, when I do I’ll come to you. I don’t
want to sell anything to Mr. Knippel.”</p>

<p>“What then.”</p>

<p>“Other business. You know he loans money once
in a while.”</p>

<p>“I know he is able to, if he wants to,” responded
the man. “See here,” he continued eagerly, “what
would it be if you came to me again. Not railroad
stuff, you know?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” answered Ben accommodatingly.</p>

<p>“Too dangerous. Prime stuff is machine shop
plunder. Especially brass and copper. I’d give
you a fair deal.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure of that,” said Ben. “Say, how am I
going to get to Knippel?”</p>

<p>“That’ll be hit and miss. He makes the rounds,
you know. He may not be around here again to
collect for a week.”</p>

<p>“Where did you say he lived?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say, but it’s at Blairville.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” nodded Ben. He remembered that it was
the town near the aero field.</p>

<p>“You take a chance of finding him there,” proceeded
the man, “he flits about so much. Sometimes
he isn’t at home once in a month.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll try and locate him somehow, much
obliged,” said our hero.</p>

<p>“Remember, now, come to me direct when you’ve
got anything to sell.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span></p>

<p>“All right.”</p>

<p>“Especially brass and copper.”</p>

<p>“Good enough,” said Ben, and left the place.</p>

<p>He walked to the railroad depot reflecting deeply.
He had made a pretentious break, a sort of bluff,
and had learned what he wanted to know. Ben sturdily
believed that the man Knippel knew a great
deal that could help his father, and now he knew
where to find him.</p>

<p>“The way I size it up,” ruminated Ben, “is that
this Knippel has a lot of people in various manufacturing
towns around here stealing things and
selling to him and his agents. This pin shows membership
in the gang. Some one dropped it in the
work shed. Who was it? Well, I’ve got my start
on this business, and I’m going to work something
tangible out of it.”</p>

<p>Ben did not tell his father of his latest experience
when he reached home. In fact, he did not
even then deliver to him the screws for which he had
been sent.</p>

<p>To his surprise he found the work yard deserted.
As he passed it, a queer, indefinable sensation of
something being out of place assailed him. Ben
paused to figure out what it was. Then he noticed
that the airship skeleton was partly dismantled and
some of its parts gone.</p>

<p>“Father, father, are you there?” he called towards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
the work shed. There was no reply. Ben
hurried towards the house. It was untenanted, but
coming out on the porch he came upon his mother.
She was standing looking down the street, anxious
faced and in tears.</p>

<p>“Why, mother, what is the matter?” exclaimed
Ben in great surprise.</p>

<p>“Oh, my son, trouble,” responded Mrs. Hardy in
a broken tone of voice.</p>

<p>“Father——”</p>

<p>“Has gone down town in urgent haste. Mr. Saxton
is at the bottom of it all.”</p>

<p>“How—explain, mother.”</p>

<p>“It was directly after you went away this morning.
Two constables appeared with what they called
writs of some kind. It seems that Mr. Saxton
claimed that a great deal of valuable automobile
parts have been missing from the plant for over a
year. The officers searched the work shed.”</p>

<p>“The villain!” fired up Ben hotly. “Did he dare
to accuse father of stealing?”</p>

<p>“It seems so,” sighed Mrs. Hardy. “The astonishing
thing is that in a corner of the shed behind
that barrel in which you keep odds and ends, they
found nearly a bushel of carburetor parts.”</p>

<p>“Then they put them there!” cried Ben. “Ah, I
understand now. The man you saw with the bag is
in the conspiracy to disgrace father. His errand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
was to place its contents where they would incriminate
us. He dumped them out and escaped before
I got into the yard.”</p>

<p>“The men then proceeded to take the metal parts
from the airship,” resumed Mrs. Hardy.</p>

<p>“Why, those never came from the Saxton plant!”
exclaimed Ben. “Father made them right here in
the work shed.”</p>

<p>“Your father protested, but the officers claimed
they were acting under sanction of the law. They
told him he had his redress, and could replevin them,
I think it was, if he could prove ownership.”</p>

<p>“Where is father now?”</p>

<p>“He hurried down town to see his lawyer and try
to get back those airship parts.”</p>

<p>“I must find him at once,” declared Ben.
“Mother, this a pretty serious affair.”</p>

<p>“It is indeed, Ben.”</p>

<p>“It is all a plot, a base, wicked plot!” cried Ben.
“Everybody knows that father is the soul of honesty.
Mr. Saxton shall suffer for this.”</p>

<p>Ben was all on fire with indignation and excitement.
He reached the office of Mr. Pearsons, his
father’s lawyer, breathless and perspiring. It was
to find his father pacing the floor in a restless, anxious
way.</p>

<p>“Oh, father,” exclaimed Ben, “this is terrible!”</p>

<p>“For Saxton, yes,” said Mr. Hardy, in his usual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
calm and trustful way. “A man who will do what
he has done, will wake up with a tormenting conscience
some day.”</p>

<p>“But what good does that do us now?”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry, my son, everything will come out
right.”</p>

<p>“It’s a pretty hard thing to see you charged
with stealing.”</p>

<p>“They will have to prove those charges, Ben.”</p>

<p>“And they have got hold of our new monoplane
parts.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Pearsons has just gone to see about those,”
said Mr. Hardy.</p>

<p>The lawyer in question entered the office at that
moment. He was in great haste. He looked stirred
up and bothered.</p>

<p>Mr. Pearsons nodded to Ben. Then he turned
towards his anxious-faced father.</p>

<p>“Well, Hardy,” he observed, “we’re dealing with
a bad crowd, I can tell you.”</p>

<p>“You mean Mr. Saxton?”</p>

<p>“And his accomplices and lawyers. The recovery
of those automobile parts was only a ruse.”</p>

<p>“A ruse?” repeated Mr. Hardy wonderingly.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“How do you mean, Mr. Pearsons?”</p>

<p>“They were really after the parts of that flying
machine of yours.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span></p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Well, Hardy,” pronounced the lawyer emphatically,
“I am satisfied that the motive of this raid
is to steal your airship inventions!”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">STEALING AN INVENTION</p>


<p>“Yes,” repeated the lawyer, “that Saxton crowd
is aiming to steal your airship inventions.”</p>

<p>Mr. Hardy sank on a chair looking blank and
troubled. Ben spoke up.</p>

<p>“How can they do that, Mr. Pearsons?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell my story, and you will see,” replied the
lawyer. “I went down to the plant and cornered
Saxton in his private office. He looked quite bored
at our prompt action. I belong to his set, and, as
he realizes, I know some of his business secrets.
He began to explain, as he called it. Thousands of
dollars worth of stuff had been stolen from the
works he claimed. Some had been found at your
house. He said he didn’t believe your intention was
to steal them, that you probably took them to select
what you wanted, and would square up later.”</p>

<p>“The hypocrite!” commented Ben hotly.</p>

<p>“I faced him right down,” went on Mr. Pearsons.
“I informed him that it was a pretty dangerous
thing to destroy a good man’s character off-hand.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
He is a man of no real backbone, and I scared him
nearly to death. He kept mumbling over that he
hoped no harm had been done, that he didn’t intend
to prosecute. I defied him to do so. I told him if
he didn’t, we would force the issue and fight him to
the last ditch, till we found out which one of his
accomplices planted those fittings in your work
shed.”</p>

<p>“Good—good!” cried Ben.</p>

<p>“Then I demanded the return of your airship
parts,” continued the lawyer. “He flushed, hemmed
and hawed, and looked flustered. Certainly he would
return them. Sure he had made a mistake. The
clumsy officers had no right to take them. All right,
I said, where were they? Saxton said they were in
the possession of the constables. If I would send
around about four o’clock they would be ready for
me. Then I opened up on him, I think I gave him a
tongue lashing he will never forget. I told him he
was a thoroughly bad man, and I would be obliged
if he didn’t speak to me when I passed him on the
street.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Pearsons, you are indeed a true friend,”
said Mr. Hardy with emotion.</p>

<p>“I know that I am that man’s enemy from this
time forth,” declared the lawyer. “He is a disgrace
to the community. As I left his place, I met
a fellow named Bogart. I got him out of jail last
year, and he has always felt very grateful to me.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
He has been doing odd jobs helping the regular
constables, and he took me aside and let the cat out
of the bag.”</p>

<p>“How do you mean?” inquired Mr. Hardy.</p>

<p>“Why, he told me that just as soon as the constable
reported to Saxton, he sent two of the airship
parts by special messenger to his lawyer. You know
who that is—that shrewd, tricky Mason, a man who
ought to be disbarred from his unscrupulous methods.
My informant said that Mason at once put
his office force at work to make drawings of the new
parts and get out specifications. They expect to
get the papers by special mail to Washington on the
two o’clock train.”</p>

<p>“It is too bad,” said Mr. Hardy gloomily.</p>

<p>“And it is now one o’clock. Is there no way to
outwit them?” asked Ben.</p>

<p>“Not in respect to getting ahead of them at Washington,”
replied Mr. Pearsons, consulting his watch.
“See here, Hardy,” he continued, approaching the
dejected inventor, and placing a friendly, encouraging
hand on his shoulder, “don’t you be downhearted.”</p>

<p>“It is a pretty bad proposition for me,” said Ben’s
father.</p>

<p>“Not altogether. We shall at once follow their
claims with our own, and we will fight it through
the courts.”</p>

<p>“That is a long and tedious process.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span></p>

<p>“It is our only alternative. You go home, don’t
worry, and leave this thing to me to untangle. To-morrow
come and see me about suing Saxton on
those automobile patents. I’m thinking we shall be
able to raise a storm about his ears that will keep
him awake nights for a spell.”</p>

<p>“Will I be able to get the airship parts to-day?”
inquired Mr. Hardy.</p>

<p>“I’ll attend to that,” assured the lawyer.</p>

<p>“I want to get Ben’s monoplane done.”</p>

<p>Mr. Hardy and Ben left the lawyer’s office. As
they reached the street, our hero paused. An idea
had come into his mind, and he said:</p>

<p>“You go home, father. I’ll join you there soon.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?”</p>

<p>“Oh I’ve got some little things to attend to about
town.”</p>

<p>Mr. Hardy proceeded on his way alone. It made
Ben sorry and fretted to observe his depressed and
downcast air.</p>

<p>“I’ll fit things if it takes all I’ve got,” said Ben
firmly, and he walked down the street and entered
the savings bank where he had deposited most of
the money received from the sale of the Sybilline
whistle.</p>

<p>Mr. Pearsons was busy at his desk when Ben
re-entered the office. He looked up somewhat surprised,
with the words:</p>

<p>“Well, what’s the trouble, Hardy?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span></p>

<p>“My father has gone home very much discouraged,”
said Ben seriously. “An idea struck me that
may change the situation somewhat, so I thought
I would come back to see you.”</p>

<p>“Very good. What then?” inquired the lawyer.</p>

<p>“Why, just this—a way to get ahead of the Saxton
crowd in filing the application for those patents.”</p>

<p>The lawyer shook his head, consulting his watch.</p>

<p>“No show, I’m sorry to say,” he declared. “It
would take fully two hours to prepare the papers.
Mason is ahead of us one mail, and no other leaves
until to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p>“I drew the design of the patents for my father,”
explained Ben. “In fact, I have the rude draft of
them in my pocket now. As to the description, I
could write out those to the smallest detail.”</p>

<p>“No use now, too late,” insisted Mr. Pearsons.</p>

<p>“Let me ask one question, please.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, lad.”</p>

<p>“Have you a correspondent in Washington?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes.”</p>

<p>“Then I suggest this: Why can’t we get up all
the necessary formation for applying for the patents,
describing them accurately, so they can be reproduced
by your correspondent, and sending word for
word the specifications, as you call them, and telegraphing
them.”</p>

<p>The lawyer fairly jumped from his seat.</p>

<p>“Hardy,” he said enthusiastically, “you are a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
genius!” And then his face shadowed, and he
shook his head.</p>

<p>“That would certainly head off the Saxton crowd,
and my correspondent at Washington is a bright
active man, but—why, Hardy, it would cost at least
one hundred dollars to telegraph all that stuff.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; I suppose so,” said Ben quietly, “so I
brought the money to pay for it. There is one
hundred and fifty dollars.”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">ON TIME</p>


<p>The lawyer sat staring in surprise at the little roll
of bills Ben had placed on the desk before him.
Then his countenance expanded.</p>

<p>“You have solved the problem, Hardy. You are
sure you want to invest all that money?”</p>

<p>“To help my father—I guess so!” replied our
hero with energy.</p>

<p>“All right,” cried Mr. Pearsons briskly, arising
from his chair. “Here sit down at that desk yonder,”
and he pointed to an inner room. “Now then,
you’re a smart boy, and I see it. Write out in the
most exact detail what you want wired.”</p>

<p>“You think your Washington correspondent can
follow out instructions explicitly?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll guarantee him.”</p>

<p>Ben went to the inner office and set to work at
once. It was fortunate that he had acted as secretary
for his father on occasions similar to the present
one. Ben made a rough draft of what he wanted
to say, and then he studied and revised it. This took
an hour of his time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span></p>

<p>When he had copied the description, he felt highly
satisfied. He believed that any ordinary draftsman
could make drawings of the airship parts from his
directions. They made four pages of foolscap.</p>

<p>“Excellent—splendid!” declared Mr. Pearsons, as
an hour later he read over Ben’s work. “I’ll send
this to Washington over the wires instanter. I shall
also instruct my correspondent to telegraph your
father if he completes the matter to-day.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mr. Pearsons.”</p>

<p>“The thanks all belong to you, Hardy,” insisted
the lawyer, with an admiring glance at Ben. “Any
time you feel like taking up with the law, there’s a
place for you in this office, remember that.”</p>

<p>“I’m too full of the airship fever to think of anything
like that just now,” smiled Ben.</p>

<p>“That’s all right, follow your bent as long as it
is a legitimate and useful one. I think you can advise
your father that we have scooped the enemy
on the first move in the game.”</p>

<p>Ben had no intention of disclosing his last action
to his father, until he was sure that his plan had met
with success. He went home and had lunch with his
father. They pottered around the work yard for
a spell. Then Ben went down town.</p>

<p>It was about five o’clock, and he was on his way
homewards again, when he ran up against Caleb
Dunn.</p>

<p>“Hold on, there, Ben Hardy,” hailed the foreman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
at the Saxton Automobile Works. “Just the fellow
I wanted to see.”</p>

<p>“What about, Mr. Dunn?”</p>

<p>“About your father’s affairs. Here, give me all
the details of this tangle with Saxton.”</p>

<p>Ben realized that the bluff, outspoken foreman
was a genuine friend of his father. He began a recital
of most of the facts concerning his father’s
present trouble.</p>

<p>A sort of a subdued growl issued from the lips
of the foreman when he had concluded. His face
was grim and angry.</p>

<p>“You come with me, Hardy,” he said promptly.</p>

<p>“Where, Mr. Dunn?”</p>

<p>“To the Saxton works.”</p>

<p>“I had rather not go there,” demurred Ben, holding
back a trifle.</p>

<p>“Got to,” declared Dunn definitely, “if I have
to lug you there bodily. You ain’t the one who will
get hurt. It’s Saxton.”</p>

<p>The foreman pranced down the street at a furious
rate. Ben kept up with him. Dunn acted like a
smouldering volcano. He gritted his teeth, he
clenched his fists ever and anon, he emitted growls
and little roars.</p>

<p>“The escape valve will burst if I don’t get action,”
he advised Ben. “Hurry up.”</p>

<p>When they reached the plant, Dunn proceeded
straight towards the private office of its proprietor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span></p>

<p>“Mr. Saxton is very busy over some accounts,”
advised the bookkeeper.</p>

<p>“He’ll see me, or I’ll burst in the door,” declared
the forcible Dunn, thrusting aside the office underling,
and opening the door before him. “You keep
with me, Hardy,” he advised.</p>

<p>Jasper Saxton looked up from his desk in an irritated
way at the bold intrusion. Then, observing
Ben, he scowled darkly.</p>

<p>“What’s that boy doing here?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“I brought him,” retorted Dunn.</p>

<p>“Take him away again. He has no business
around here.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he has, and he’ll stay,” observed Dunn
sharply. “I need him.”</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“As a witness.”</p>

<p>“Witness to what?” demanded Saxton, with a
blank stare.</p>

<p>“To what I’m going to tell you. Saxton, you are
an unmitigated scoundrel!”</p>

<p>“W—what?”</p>

<p>With a bound the manufacturer came to his feet.
He seemed about to spring upon his audacious foreman.
He doubled up his fists and tried to awe the
venturesome Dunn, who coolly looked him in the eye.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” derided the foreman. “Try it. Just
once! I think I’d be willing to pay a big fine just
for the excuse to give you the beating of your life.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span></p>

<p>“What’s that? what’s this?” gasped the astonished
Saxton.</p>

<p>“Say,” continued his foreman in sharp, cutting
tones. “I’ve worked my last stroke for the meanest
man I ever knew. You’ve lost a better man in
Martin Hardy, but you’ll miss me just the same.
Saxton, you are a thief. You stole poor Hardy’s
automobile patents. You are now trying to rob him
of his airship patents. You’ve sold your soul outright,
and I predict that you’ll go down in failure
and disgrace. I’m through with you, and in time
every decent man in your employ will leave you in
the lurch. You sent me out to-day to use my influence
to get that big motor-cycle order from the
Evans people. Well, I’ve got it, and I’m going to
turn it over to the Diebold works. You unmitigated
scoundrel! Come, Hardy.”</p>

<p>Ben saw Jasper Saxton, white and trembling, sink
back into his chair in a heap, collapsed. As they
got outside, his impetuous but determined companion
left him summarily, with the words:</p>

<p>“Tell your father I shall be up to see him this
evening.”</p>

<p>“Whew!” commented Ben, in one long marveling
breath.</p>

<p>His step was brisk and his face beaming as he
went homewards. Things had taken a turn. If
he and his father had met with some misfortunes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
the same had brought to their rescue staunch, loyal
friends.</p>

<p>Ben told his father about Mr. Dunn, and Mr.
Hardy brightened up somewhat. After supper Ben
went down town to the village telegraph office. He
knew the night despatcher, who welcomed him with
a friendly smile.</p>

<p>“Nothing for my father, is there, Mr. Noyes?”
asked Ben.</p>

<p>“Nothing so far. Expecting something?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, it may come in the half rate grist. That
begins soon. Won’t you wait?”</p>

<p>Ben sat down. The dispatcher attended to his
wires. Then, as a new clicking succeeded to a brief
lapse in business, he smiled and nodded at Ben, while
writing out the message.</p>

<p>“I’ll deliver it to my father,” said our hero. “Don’t
mind an envelope.”</p>

<p>“Just receipt for him, then,” advised the operator,
handing Ben the yellow sheet. “Charges prepaid.”</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” shouted Ben irrepressibly, as he
glanced at the sheet and summarily bolted from the
place, a keen delight overcoming his embarrassment.</p>

<p>His eyes sparkled and he ran like the wind all
the way home. He was the messenger of good news,
indeed. As he came to the house he found the sitting
room illuminated brightly. It cheered his heart
to observe his father laughing cheerily, while there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
was a growing happy expression on the face of
his mother.</p>

<p>They had company. Two men were in the same
room. They were Caleb Dunn, and Mr. Earle from
the Diebold machine shops at Martinville.</p>

<p>Ben paused unobserved at the open window of the
sitting room to learn that Earle had made a splendid
offer to his father to start in at work at Martinville.</p>

<p>Then our hero entered the house through the
kitchen. On the table he noticed the airship parts
that had been returned.</p>

<p>“Father,” he said, bursting rather unceremoniously
upon the group in the sitting room, the open
telegram in his hand, “here is some good news for
you.”</p>

<p>Mr. Hardy took the paper. He was trembling
all over as he perused it. A look of intense joy
illumined his usually serious face.</p>

<p>The telegram read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Claim filed on two airship inventions of Martin
Hardy. All rights protected.”</p>

<p class="center">THE FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR PRIZE</p>


<p>“The <em>Dart</em> is a beauty! I’d like to meet that ingenious
father of yours, Ben!”</p>

<p>“He would feel honored to know you, I am sure,
Mr. Davis.”</p>

<p>“Just as soon as this meet is over, I am going to
get him to build me a new airship modeled after
the <em>Dart</em>. It’s the best machine I have yet seen.”</p>

<p>“You will have to deal with the Diebold people,
then, Mr. Davis,” advised Ben. “They have gone
into the airship business, and father is superintendent
of that department of their plant.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll have to be contented with his supervision,”
observed the old aviator. “I would a good
deal rather pay him for special individual service.”</p>

<p>“That would be pretty difficult for the present.
My father is putting in all his spare time at home on
what he calls an Airatorium.”</p>

<p>“And what is that, Ben?” inquired Mr. Davis
with interest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span></p>

<p>“A safe, substantial airship for sick people—a
sort of an aerial hospital. His idea is to construct
a machine that will take invalids up into perfect
sunshine, pure air and exhilarating calmness.”</p>

<p>“I see—a grand idea.”</p>

<p>“Father says that light at high elevations is richer
in ultra violet rays.”</p>

<p>“Say, you’re some scientist, aren’t you?” put in
Bob Dallow.</p>

<p>“I’ll give you some more,” laughed Ben: “You
get out of the bacterial effect in the upper air currents.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll have a talk with Mr. Hardy after we’ve
won the high flight and long distance prizes,” observed
Mr. Davis.</p>

<p>“Oh, you are going to win both of them, are
you?” chuckled Bob.</p>

<p>“I said ‘we,’” corrected Mr. Davis, with a quick
glance at Ben. “I have made my record on the elevation
feature. What do you say, Ben, to taking
my place and seeing what the <em>Dart</em> can do?”</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed Ben, “you don’t mean it?”</p>

<p>“I do, and you shall,” replied the old aviator
promptly. “It’s your heart’s desire—eh? And you
would like to get that five hundred dollar prize to
help your father carry on his suit against Saxton.”</p>

<p>“I say, Bob,” cried Ben quickly, “you have been
telling secrets out of school.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span></p>

<p>“I am glad he did, for I am interested in both
you and your father,” spoke up the aviator. “Your
ambition is most laudable. I have entered the <em>Dart</em>
for the race to-morrow, and I fully expect you will
get ready for it.”</p>

<p>Ben was once more at the aviation field at Blairville
and the <em>Dart</em> was with him. That splendid
little machine had arrived from Woodville the day
previous.</p>

<p>Two weeks had been devoted to its completion,
and a perfect monoplane was the result. It had
many new features that evoked the interest and admiration
of some of the leading aviators at the meet.</p>

<p>Mr. Hardy and Caleb Dunn had accepted excellent
positions at Martinville. Tom Shallock had
carried out his boasts. He was now head machinist
at the Saxton Automobile Works. A week after
he had taken charge three men left the Saxton employ,
and Ben heard incidentally that Shallock had
become generally disliked by his fellow employees
and was under the influence of liquor most of the
time.</p>

<p>It was said that Saxton nearly had a fit when he
found out how his evil plots had been circumvented
by the Hardys in securing the airship patents first.
Saxton troubled them no further. The report that
Mr. Hardy had been guilty of stealing found few
believers. One day Ben met the big manufacturer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
skulking down the street, as if he feared every minute
being served with the papers by lawyer Pearsons.</p>

<p>When Ben made his second visit to the aviation
field, he found Dick Farrell still in the employ of
Rollins. Ben always spoke pleasantly to Dick, but
the latter greeted this courtesy with a sullen nod
only. There was a vindictive look in Farrell’s eye
that Ben distrusted fully.</p>

<p>Several times Ben went into Blairville and finally
located the home of Knippel. This man lived in a
retired cottage, had a small family who associated
with no one in the village, and he was considered
to follow some mysterious business that took him
away from home most of the time.</p>

<p>Now Ben’s thoughts were so completely on aviation
and all of its alluring features, that he forgot
all his past trouble and present complications.</p>

<p>That day he had made several trial flights. He
had the advantage of the experience and direction
of Mr. Davis and Bob. He understood the <em>Dart</em>
perfectly. Ben could hardly sleep for excitement
that night, and he and Bob were among the earliest
arrivals on the aviation field next morning.</p>

<p>The day was warm and still, but there were lowering
clouds. After a critical decision as to weather
conditions, Mr. Davis told Ben that the same were
not very favorable for either a high or a rapid flight.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
Eight biplanes and four monoplanes were to take
part in the test. Ben chose his own course away
from the others. Bob, after urging up the <em>Dart</em>,
uttered an enthusiastic hurrah as he noted the splendid
start his friend had made.</p>

<p>The <em>Dart</em> was soon out of sight, the heavy layer
of surface clouds obscuring its progress. Ben
started in on a spiral flight. As he struck a second
strata of clouds, he encountered some strong cross
currents of air.</p>

<p>“It’s getting choppy,” ruminated the young aviator,
and he arranged so he could lower the front
control of the machine readily in case of a sudden
gust.</p>

<p>It began to get chilly and uncomfortable as he
struck a higher altitude. His leather suit was none
too warm for him and splatters of moisture clouded
the goggles he wore.</p>

<p>Ben bent himself to his work like a trained pilot.
There were places where great banks of cloud enveloped
him. He drove the monoplane through
these like a torpedo boat thrusting its way through
an opposing wave.</p>

<p>“Brr-rr!” he shivered, as an icy gale made the
planes bend and rattle, and he felt himself becoming
benumbed by the cold.</p>

<p>The highly rarefied air began now to affect heart
and brain. Only by conserving his breath could Ben
refrain from gasping outright.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span></p>

<p>“What is that?” he exclaimed, as a grinding,
wrenching motion shook the machine.</p>

<p>It was an accumulation of ice on the planes of the
airship. Icicles fell into the machinery, threatening
to stop the motor.</p>

<p>“I’ve reached the limit, I guess,” decided Ben,
dizzy-headed and half frozen.</p>

<p>A storm of hail cut against him as he made a full
one mile glide. Then strata after strata of clouds
were penetrated. A blurred landscape and dim outlines
of houses and trees gradually came into view.
When Ben alighted, both he and the aeroplane were
coated with ice.</p>

<p>He had to be helped from the machine, but, benumbed
as he was with the cold, he was conscious
of ringing cheers all about the aviation field.</p>

<p>Mr. Davis carried the barograph from the machine
to the judges’ stand. Bob and some others
led and carried Ben to the quarters of the <em>Flyer</em>.</p>

<p>Ben found it supreme luxury to repose on a
couch. His lungs pained him, and he was so exhausted
he dropped into profound sleep at once.</p>

<p>His next conscious moment was a recognition of
the voice of Mr. Davis, saying:</p>

<p>“Let him sleep, he needs it.”</p>

<p>“But—such glorious news!” cried the tones of
Bob Dallow.</p>

<p>“I am awake,” declared Ben, opening his eyes
and sitting up. “What’s the glorious news?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span></p>

<p>“Why,” said Mr. Davis with a beaming face, “the
barograph says you have beaten the <em>Flyer</em> altitude
record by three hundred feet. Hardy, you have won
the five hundred dollar prize.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">“GO!”</p>


<p>“Ben, Ben, wake up!”</p>

<p>“What is the matter—what has happened?”</p>

<p>“The very worst—the Davis quarters is on fire
and the <em>Flyer</em> is burning up.”</p>

<p>Ben bounded from the mattress on which he lay.
He did not have to grope to find his clothes. A
great glare shone into the little shed which he and
Bob had occupied since the <em>Dart</em> had arrived on the
field. It was some distance from the Davis place,
and had a canvas extension which housed the Woodville
machine.</p>

<p>Bob was getting into his clothes, uttering excited
disjointed sentences, meanwhile keeping his eyes
fixed on the center of the fiery glare.</p>

<p>“It is certainly in the direction of the Davis
quarters,” said Ben hurriedly, “but it may not be
his place.”</p>

<p>“But it is. Can’t you see—the exact location, and
two men rushing by shouted that it was.”</p>

<p>Fleet-footed and breathless, the two youths<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
dashed across the patch of sward between their new
quarters and the blazing pile. Half the distance
accomplished, their worst fears were verified.</p>

<p>“It’s the <em>Flyer</em>,” panted Bob.</p>

<p>The roaring flames and excited shouts kept up
a wild uproar about a vivid midnight picture. There
was no water supply on the field. Before the Blairville
fire department could be summoned the aerodrome
would be in ashes. The only thing that helpers
could do was to get long poles and pull the blazing
canvas off the shelter tent away from the frame
extension of the Davis living quarters.</p>

<p>“It’s all gone up, tent and machine,” choked out
Bob, as they came directly upon the scene.</p>

<p>“Yes, and—oh—Mr. Davis is hurt.”</p>

<p>Ben rushed up to the old aviator as he spoke.
Two men were leading Mr. Davis from the smouldering
ruins. The way they helped him hold his
hands showed that he had met with some accident.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Davis,” cried Ben, “what is it?”</p>

<p>The aviator turned a pale and troubled face on
his young assistant.</p>

<p>“Yes, Ben!” he said, forcing a smile, “don’t get
scared. Just a singe or two on the hands.”</p>

<p>Ben saw that the sleeves of the coat Mr. Davis
wore hung in shriveled threads. His hands were
seared and blistered.</p>

<p>“A little liniment will fix me up all right,” said
the aviator with affected cheerfulness, as he noticed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
the deep concern on the face of Bob as well as that
of Ben. “Keep your nerve, lads, you may need it
to-morrow.”</p>

<p>His helper, as the man was called who had oiled
and taken care of the <em>Flyer</em>, came up at that moment.</p>

<p>“Here, Jones,” called the aviator, halting. “Have
you got a good revolver?”</p>

<p>“Two of them, Mr. Davis.”</p>

<p>“Get them both, and start up to the <em>Dart</em> quarters
without a minute’s delay. Don’t keep your eye off
the machine a single minute until I relieve you at
daylight. If any skulker comes within ten feet of
the place, pepper him. You, Ben Hardy, come
along with me.”</p>

<p>The old aviator spoke like some commanding
general. There was a sternness to his expression
that was significant. As he entered the door of
the quarters he cast a backward glance at the smouldering
wreck of the <em>Flyer</em> and sighed. Then his
face became set and grim.</p>

<p>“My lads here will attend to me, friends,” he
spoke to the two men who had helped him.</p>

<p>“Can’t we be of some use to you, Mr. Davis?”
inquired one of them.</p>

<p>“Why, yes, come to think of it. I wish one of
you would tell Mr. Bridges I want to see him, the
quicker the better.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span></p>

<p>“He may be in bed, if the fire hasn’t routed him
out.”</p>

<p>“Then wake him up—it’s very important.”</p>

<p>The men departed. The aviator planted himself
in an armchair and gave his orders to Ben and Bob.
Very soon they had the sleeves of his coat cut off
at the elbow. Without a wince or a groan Mr.
Davis directed them like a skilled surgeon. Liniment
was applied to his burns, cotton and bandages
set in place, and finally the old aviator sank back
in real or affected comfort, with the words:</p>

<p>“That’s fine. It doesn’t bring back the <em>Flyer</em>,
poor old friend, but it mends me up for the tussle.”</p>

<p>“You aren’t thinking of trying for to-morrow,
with your hands in that condition?” interrogated
Bob.</p>

<p>Before the aviator could reply, Mr. Bridges had
arrived. He was the director of the meet, its high
executive official.</p>

<p>“Dear me, Davis,” he exclaimed in genuine concern,
“this is a serious affair. I needn’t tell you
I am dreadfully sorry. Have you sent for a doctor.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” nodded the aviator with a smile, “you.”</p>

<p>“Eh?”</p>

<p>“That’s it—I want you to doctor up to-morrow’s
programme.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it will be a severe disappointment to the
public—no <em>Flyer</em>, no Davis.”</p>

<p>“But I wish to be represented, just the same.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span></p>

<p>“Oh.”</p>

<p>“Now, see here, Bridges,” proceeded the old aviator,
“there is not the least occasion in the world
for red tape. It’s a plain, simple proposition of a
plain, straightforward man. I have a place on the
programme. I claim it.”</p>

<p>“But you have no airship to enter.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have—the <em>Dart</em>.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see,” nodded the director, “very good.
Operator?”</p>

<p>“Operators—two: Dallow and Hardy. Make a
note of it officially, Bridges, and see that we have
a fair show.”</p>

<p>“It’s a little irregular, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“So was the burning of the <em>Flyer</em>,” remarked
Mr. Davis dryly.</p>

<p>“Any suspicions?”</p>

<p>“If I have any, they will keep until this meet is
over. Then I may have something to say. Can I
depend on the substitute entry as I make it, with no
quibbling?”</p>

<p>“You can depend on any service I can give an old
friend and a square man,” assured the director
heartily.</p>

<p>“Thank you. You give that fair show, and I’ll
try and keep up the Davis reputation.”</p>

<p>The aviation director retired with a courteous
bow. As the door closed on him, Mr. Davis turned
his glance upon his two young assistants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span></p>

<p>“Well?” he demanded with a quizzical smile.</p>

<p>“You have dazed me,” spoke Ben, with a wondering
break in his voice. “Do you really mean it?”</p>

<p>“Same here,” piped in Bob. “It’s like getting a
fortune all at once.”</p>

<p>“Oho! so you are counting on the prize already,
are you?” chuckled Mr. Davis.</p>

<p>“Isn’t that what you expect us to do?” challenged
Bob.</p>

<p>“I reckon it is,” assented the aviator.</p>

<p>“Then we will try, Mr. Davis,” said Ben, a tremor
of excitement in his voice, but rare determination
in his eye, “we will try hard.”</p>

<p>“That’s the talk,” said the aviator encouragingly.
“Now then, bring that little stand close to my side.”</p>

<p>Ben obeyed the order.</p>

<p>“Open that yellow paper. Spread it out. Both of
you sit down close up to me. This is a special
weather report that arrived five hours ago. The
red lines and notations are mine. Listen carefully,
and try and catch my idea of the surest and easiest
course for to-morrow’s run.”</p>

<p>Both boys were impressed with the intensest interest
and admiration, as the old aviator explained
his ideas. Mr. Davis had marked out a zig-zag
course to the northwest. At a glance, Ben could
discern how carefully he had calculated and planned
with expert skill.</p>

<p>Taking wind velocity, temperature readings, barometric<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
depressions and storm centres for a basis,
the wise old aviator had blocked out a course like a
pilot at sea directing his ship through sandbars, reefs
and counter winds. Where there was a cross air
current, a mark designated it. He even indicated
the altitude average.</p>

<p>“Why,” cried the exuberant Bob, “you make
it a mere playing, Mr. Davis!”</p>

<p>“Do I?” retorted the old aviator grimly. “You
may change your mind after a four hour’s spin.
It’s no fun, lads.”</p>

<p>“I do not see how we can fail to do something
quite fair, under all these conditions,” said Ben.</p>

<p>“It will be simply a question of the gasolene supply,”
explained Mr. Davis. “There, however, is
where that auxiliary pipe feature your father has invented
comes in good. Now then, I want you to
go to bed and shut your eyes and minds to the world
till I wake you up. Remember, you have the biggest
day of your lives before you, and you will need your
best nerve and strength to meet it.”</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” crowed the irrepressible Bob.</p>

<p>“We’ll say that when we win,” added Ben.</p>

<p>They were not awakened until eight o’clock the
next morning. Bob began to worry, and Ben himself
was flustered at the lateness of the hour.</p>

<p>“Easy, now,” ordered Mr. Davis, “you two fellows
are simply dummies in the hands of trainers
till we land you in the <em>Dart</em>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Davis had sent for two new aviation suits
for the boys, the latest and best that could be procured.
They fitted comfortably, and the boys made
a fine professional appearance in them.</p>

<p>Mr. Davis had left them to chat together over
their meal. When they rejoined him in his sitting
room, they found him with two telegrams lying open
on the stand before him.</p>

<p>“Change the course as I direct, Ben,” he said.
“The weather conditions are practically the same as
last night’s report showed, except at two points.
I’ll name them to you. Make a westerly deviation
at the first, and take a high level at the second.”</p>

<p>Ben did as he was directed. Bob, leaning over his
shoulder, made a wry face.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you?” inquired Mr.
Davis quickly.</p>

<p>“Huh!” complained Bob, “you’ve marked out
only a thousand-mile run.”</p>

<p>“Hear him! A thousand miles? Why, if you
have enough backbone to beat six hundred and fifty
miles, you win the prize,” declared the old aviator.</p>

<p>It was a grandly inspiriting scene, that upon which
Ben Hardy and Bob Dallow entered an hour later.
The sun was bright, the sky was clear and speckless
of a single cloud, the air brisk and invigorating. It
was a typical day for air sailing, and the young
sky pilots felt hopefully at their best.</p>

<p>The aviation field was a gay and entrancing spectacle.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
At its edge were gathered several thousand
spectators, automobiles, motor-cycles and other vehicles,
some trimmed in gala array. Pennants were
strung here and there about the field, and the nine
aeroplanes entered for the contest were as pretty as
dainty birds, straining to try their wings in the empyrean.</p>

<p>Hails and cheers rang out in every direction.
There was hearty applause as Ben and Bob, the
youngest aviators in the contest, took their places
in the <em>Dart</em>. Ben tried the levers and the other various
parts of the machine.</p>

<p>“She works like a watch,” he declared to his companion.</p>

<p>“Ready,” was Bob’s reply, his eye on the judge’s
stand.</p>

<p>Boom!—flared forth the signal gun, followed by
a general chorus, uttered in the word so thrilling to
the heart of the enthusiastic aviator:</p>

<p>“Go!”</p>

<p>Lifted from earth on a superb sweep, true to its
name, the <em>Dart</em> arose on a splendid arrow course.
There was a fascinating spiral whirl as the graceful
aeroplane struck an upper air current. Then, fondly,
longingly viewed by the old aviator and his friends,
the <em>Dart</em> diminished, became a mere speck, and faded
away in the far distance.</p>

<p class="center">CRUSOES OF THE AIR</p>


<p>“It’s business now,” said Bob Dallow, between
his teeth.</p>

<p>“And guesswork,” added Ben. “Hit or miss,
though, we’ve got to make land. The tank register
is at the exhaust line. Where do you suppose we
are, Bob?”</p>

<p>“Brr-rr! Judging from the weather, Medicine
Hat. The way we’ve spun along, I should think
we were just about over Alaska.”</p>

<p>“That’s nonsense, of course,” responded Ben,
“but we have done some travelling. Keep watch
on the forward planes, now.”</p>

<p>The young aviators were veritable Crusoes of the
air, marooned in cloudland, lost in a void of ether.
As Bob aptly expressed the situation, it was business
now, sharp and serious.</p>

<p>The <em>Dart</em> had made a splendid run. At first it
had been an experience of fun, novelty and interest
for its light-hearted crew. The vast panorama
spread out under them had been entrancing. Up to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
mid afternoon they knew pretty well where they
were. Bob kept close track of the chart markings,
and when they descended on top of a high hill near
a little town, they were soon visited by curious
throngs from the village near by, and knew that they
were over two hundred and fifty miles from the
starting point.</p>

<p>“That’s not so bad,” observed Bob, “over sixty
miles an hour.”</p>

<p>“Not if we can keep up a long flight,” said Ben.</p>

<p>This had been their only stopping place. It cost
them over two hours’ time. They had some difficulty
in securing a new gasolene supply and other
things they needed. The machine was carefully
oiled and the flight resumed, the bold aviators feeling
encouraged by the tremendous cheering of a
throng viewing a real monoplane for the first time.</p>

<p>Two hours later real work began. They had
something of a tussle fighting an ugly cross current
of air. Next a storm cloud interfered. They lost
their bearings somewhat, and as dusk came on they
were entirely at sea as to location.</p>

<p>About ten o’clock in the evening, after a visit to
the lower atmosphere, the air voyagers became assured
of one fact: They were no longer traversing
a settled range of territory. The night was black,
and had become foggy. It had grown chill and uncomfortable
as well.</p>

<p>There was not a speck of light visible earthwards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
anywhere. One long sweep took them over a vast
body of water. Then came an interminable stretch
of vast forests.</p>

<p>“We seem to have passed civilization,” remarked
Ben.</p>

<p>“We are clear out of the United States, anyway,”
declared Bob.</p>

<p>“My plan is to get to a good altitude and put the
motors to the limit,” was Ben’s suggestion.</p>

<p>“All right, if we can stand the cold.”</p>

<p>The experiments of the half dozen ensuing hours
neither of the young aviators ever forgot. It was
a real endurance test. There was cold, darkness, uncertainty,
discomfort and peril to combat. Only
that the splendid little <em>Dart</em> behaved grandly, were
they able to keep up an uninterrupted forward progress.
Then there were many bad tips and tilts, but
skill and attention evaded any real mishap.</p>

<p>“We have driven our craft to the last limit of
speed,” announced Ben at last. “The fuel gauge
is at danger line.”</p>

<p>“That settles it, then,” said Bob. “It’s all over
but the barograph readings, now.”</p>

<p>Ben set the <em>Dart</em> on a downward slant. It was
high time to descend. As they pierced a broad ribbon
of dense cloud and made out outlines of hills
and trees below, the chug—chug of the motor grew
fainter and less distinct. The sound diminished
finally to a choking gasp, and the <em>Dart</em> rested on a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
broad even surface in the midst of great trees,
almost of its own volition.</p>

<p>“We made it just in time,” said Bob, climbing
from the machine with an immense sigh of relief.
“What time is it, Ben?”</p>

<p>Ben lighted a match and consulted the dial of
the treasured timepiece presented to him by the employees
of the Saxton Automobile Works.</p>

<p>“Just fifteen minutes after one,” he announced.</p>

<p>“Then we have been fourteen hours on the spin,”
calculated Bob. “I don’t believe any of the others
have beat that.”</p>

<p>“We don’t know that, of course.”</p>

<p>“It’s surely nine hundred miles,” continued Bob,
“maybe twelve hundred. It seemed to me we just
spun along these last four hours.”</p>

<p>“We have done finely,” declared Ben, “and we
should feel pretty glad to land with no mishaps.”</p>

<p>While his companion was seeking for the food
sack in the body of the machine, Ben was unshipping
some of the planes and wiring the wheels to near
tree stumps, so the flying machine could not be
budged if a sudden wind came up.</p>

<p>“I wonder where we are, Ben?” inquired Bob,
appearing with the canvas bag that held some tools
and a bulky package of food.</p>

<p>“No telling. I couldn’t keep track of direction
after it got dark.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span></p>

<p>“We’re probably out of the range of running fuel
anyway,” surmised Bob.</p>

<p>“Yes, I think that is right.”</p>

<p>“What’s the programme, then?”</p>

<p>“Why, we can only wait till morning, get our
bearings, locate some village and tell our story.
Some reputable people must come to the monoplane
with us, seal up the speedometer, make affidavits
as to our arrival, and we get back to Mr. Davis to
report.”</p>

<p>“And leave the <em>Dart</em> here?” questioned Bob, in
alarm.</p>

<p>“Certainly not. We must arrange to have it
packed and shipped on after us, no matter what it
may cost.”</p>

<p>“If we have only won the prize—oh, if we only
have!” began Bob ardently, and then: “Hello!”</p>

<p>The speaker dropped the hunk of bread and cheese
he was eating with a vivid exclamation, and stood
poised in a staring attitude, glancing through the
surrounding trees.</p>

<p>“What now, Bob?” questioned Ben.</p>

<p>“A light.”</p>

<p>“I see it!”</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s a village—a house, anyhow. The
sooner we prove our arrival, the better for our
claims, eh, Ben?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps.”</p>

<p>“Come on—this is luck.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span></p>

<p>Ben hesitated for a moment. He did not like to
leave the <em>Dart</em>. Still, it was safely secured, and
scarcely liable to discovery in that remote and solitary
place. He joined his companion, and they
started in the direction of the light.</p>

<p>Bob was so eager and excited that he did not
leave the bag behind, but kept possession of it, slinging
it over one shoulder by the piece of flexible wire
running through the handles.</p>

<p>The two journeyers did not note their environment
particularly. They had several tumbles going
down a sheer hilly descent. They encountered fallen
trees and brambles threading a jungle-like maze.
All the time, however, they kept the distant light in
view as a beacon. This led to many turns and windings
to evade obstructing objects.</p>

<p>“Whew!” ejaculated Bob at last, as they came to
some kind of a stream. “We must have gone miles.
I’m footsore and wringing wet with perspiration.”</p>

<p>“That light is across the river, and miles away
yet,” said Ben.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll line the stream and cross when we
get nearer. We can’t miss reaching it now.”</p>

<p>They proceeded on this basis. Less than half a
mile accomplished, however, both halted simultaneously
with a shock.</p>

<p>“Gone!” cried Ben in consternation.</p>

<p>“Yes,” groaned his disappointed comrade.</p>

<p>The point of light seemed suddenly to lift in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
air. It divided into whirling darts of flame, and
then into a cascade of sparks. Then there was a
black blank where the radiance had shown.</p>

<p>“Don’t you see?” cried Bob, in a dismayed tone.</p>

<p>“See what?”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t a lamp. It was a campfire. Some one
probably stopping to cook a bite. He kicked out
the fire and went on.”</p>

<p>“It looks that way,” assented Ben slowly.</p>

<p>“Yell at the top of your voice,” directed Bob,
seizing Ben’s arm to enforce his suggestion.</p>

<p>They united their voices in a series of ringing
shouts and yells. The silent wilderness about them
rang with the vivid echoes. For the space of two
minutes they bent their ears in anxious, eager suspense.</p>

<p>“You see, we are too far away to be heard,” said
Ben.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid so,” replied Bob, in deep disappointment.</p>

<p>“Hark! I heard something,” interrupted Ben
sharply.</p>

<p>“Yes, a sound—a sort of roar. Behind us, though.
Oh, my!”</p>

<p>Bob grasped his companion’s arm and dragged
him forward.</p>

<p>“Run! run!” he shouted. “It’s a bear.”</p>

<p class="center">A FIGHT WITH A BEAR</p>


<p>The night was dark and cloudy and there was
not a star in sight. However, it was possible to discover
outlines at a near distance. As Ben cast a
startled glance at a great bushy object not twenty
feet away, growling savagely and moving directly
towards them, he realized that there was some foundation
to his companion’s startling statement.</p>

<p>“Quick, this way. Climb up, I say,” shouted Bob,
his rapid run landing them directly up against a
large tree.</p>

<p>“You first, Bob.”</p>

<p>“Me last. Climb, I tell you!” screamed Bob.
“Whew! that was close.”</p>

<p>Ben had grasped at a low limb of the tree. He
was conscious that Bob clambered up directly after
him, but not so readily.</p>

<p>“That was just in time,” panted Bob, as both
got to a higher limb of the tree. “Got the heel of
my shoe, that’s all.”</p>

<p>Below, two baneful orbs of flickering radiance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
glowered up at them. The bear growled fiercely
and began scratching at the hard bark of the tree.</p>

<p>It was a benumbing realization to the two boys to
come direct from a safe civilization within less than
twenty-four hours into a district infested with savage
wild beasts.</p>

<p>“He’s climbing!” cried Bob.</p>

<p>“We must go higher.”</p>

<p>“Then so will he.”</p>

<p>“We have no firearms.”</p>

<p>“No,” replied the doughty Bob, “but there’s a
good stout hammer in the bag, and I’m going to
see what I can do with it. Here’s a candle, light it.
They say a light keeps bears at bay.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t this one,” reported Ben a minute
later.</p>

<p>“That’s so. Keep it going so I can see, though,
but be ready to climb if I don’t make it.”</p>

<p>The head of the hammer Bob was wielding was
flat and heavy. Its reverse end ran to quite a point.
He swung slightly down from the limb they occupied.
As the bear got four feet up the tree, the
dauntless Bob reached out.</p>

<p>The hammer landed on one forepaw of the bear.
The animal growled and drew the paw away as if
easing it from the pain. Bob swung lower. He
made a terrific swoop with his only weapon.</p>

<p>“Something cracked!” he shouted in encouraging
tones. “It told, Ben. Down he goes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span></p>

<p>The head of the hammer had landed against the
snarling mouth of the bear. Judging from the
sound, the blow had smashed one or two of his
molars. Dropped to the trunk of the tree, bruin
now rubbed his face with his paws in an angry
growling way, and the light of the candle showed
blood dripping from the ponderous jaws of the
animal.</p>

<p>“He won’t venture up again, I reckon,” remarked
Bob.</p>

<p>“No, but he seems settled down there for the
night.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll have to stay up here all night,” responded
Bob.</p>

<p>The bear now lay flat on the ground at the base
of the tree, his eyes fixed obliquely towards his treed
enemies. There was no doubt that the angry animal
had taken up the patient position of a watcher
and waiter.</p>

<p>“I say,” observed Ben, after a moment’s cogitation,
“I have an idea, if we want to drive the bear
away.”</p>

<p>“Well, he isn’t very pleasant company to have
around.”</p>

<p>“Have you any of ignition oil in the bag?”</p>

<p>“Yes, two cans of it,” reported Bob, inspecting
the contents of the bag.</p>

<p>“Give me one. That’s it. Now, you hold the
candle and get out a coil of wire.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span></p>

<p>“What’s the stunt.”</p>

<p>“You will see. It may not work.”</p>

<p>Ben unscrewed the top of the can of highly inflammable
oil. Then, poising just right, he leaned
over and let its contents drop upon the broad extended
body of the bear.</p>

<p>The animal sniffed and turned its head to one
side as the pungent odor of the oil assailed its nostrils.
It did not budge, however, while its eyes
glowered up into the tree more dangerously than
ever.</p>

<p>“Its hide is pretty well soaked,” reported Ben, as
the contents of the can became exhausted. “Now
then, attach the candle to the wire, lower it,
and——”</p>

<p>“Fire up. Ha! ha! Ben, quite an idea.”</p>

<p>The bear uttered a ferocious growl and swept
the air with one paw furiously as the candle approached.
Its aim was futile, however. The candle
reached the oil-soaked hide. There was a blinding
sweep of flame.</p>

<p>In one second the great animal was swept by a
brilliant wave of fire. It was only a surface skim,
but, scared to death, the bear arose with magical
swiftness, uttered a piercing roar, made for the river
bank, took a header, and the boys heard a tremendous
splash in the water twenty feet below.</p>

<p>“I don’t think his bearship will trouble us any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
further,” remarked Bob, preparing to descend from
the tree.</p>

<p>“No,” replied Ben, “but some other bear or animal
may. I suggest that we climb to that big crotch
up yonder. It looks roomy and comfortable. We
can only wander around aimlessly in the darkness.
We’ll take a good rest, and start out in earnest to
find out where we are as soon as daylight comes.”</p>

<p>They found the upper tree crotch roomy enough
to lie in on a slant. They decided on alternate hour
watches, and had a good lunch before they began
the arrangement for passing the night.</p>

<p>“How is the commissary department, Bob?” inquired
Ben, as they descended to the ground after
daylight.</p>

<p>“Enough to last a whole day, I should think,”
replied Bob.</p>

<p>They had an ample breakfast. Then there was
some indecision as to their immediate progress.</p>

<p>“We know about where the <em>Dart</em> is,” said Bob.
“The river is a kind of a landmark. I suggest that
we try to find some houses or settlement.”</p>

<p>“That’s south,” said Ben, pointing, after consulting
a small compass he carried with him. “Suppose
we start in that direction.”</p>

<p>“I’m agreeable,” assented his lively comrade.
“We’re bound to land somewhere.”</p>

<p>The two youths were in fine spirit, and chatted
animatedly until noon. There was so much to think<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
of—the successful trip, the return home, the possible
prize. A shower came up, and in seeking shelter
they wandered away from the river. They could
not locate it again after a two hours’ search, and
night came on, finding them in a deep gully shut in
by high frowning walls of rock.</p>

<p>Ben, somewhat subdued, set about arranging some
boulders to protect the opening of a cave-like depression
where they had decided to spend the night.</p>

<p>“I say, Ben,” observed Bob, “there’s just about
two more meals left in the bag—light ones, too.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, this won’t last,” declared Ben hopefully.
“We found some berries and nuts to-day,
and maybe with grubbing we might discover something
else that would tide us over.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s so,” assented Bob, but not at all enthusiastically.
“It don’t change a pretty serious
situation, though.”</p>

<p>“How is that?”</p>

<p>“Well, we’re in a howling wilderness, aren’t we?”</p>

<p>“It’s the wilderness all right,” assented Ben.</p>

<p>“And we face two sure conclusions,” went on
Bob Dallow, “we’ve lost the <em>Dart</em> and can’t find it,
and we’re lost ourselves.”</p>

</div>

<p class="center">A FRIEND IN NEED</p>


<p>“We will have to get some more wood.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Ben. It won’t do to let the fire go down,
with a lot of all kinds of wild and bloodthirsty
animals hanging around.”</p>

<p>“Provided any disturb us.”</p>

<p>“There’s the risk, isn’t there?” demanded Bob.
“I saw sure signs of a bear, and a den that looked
like a panther’s home. Come on. Two more big
armfuls will pull us through.”</p>

<p>After a second day of weary aimless wanderings,
the aviator refugees had made a camp under a tree
near a little thicket. They had built a fire as night
came on, had divided the last bread and meat in the
bag, and were trying to forget the disappointments
of the day and the discouraging outlook of the morrow.</p>

<p>They were soon busily engaged in gathering up
dead pieces of wood at the edge of the thicket. The
reflection from the campfire aided them in their
work. Ben had a heavy branch with which he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
poked up pieces of dead wood covered by leaves.
These he would throw into a heap at one side, to
which his comrade was also adding by his efforts.</p>

<p>Ben was thinking of home and the anxiety of his
parents. He tried to banish the blues by whistling
a jolly tune. As he started to probe with a stick in
a mass of matted leaves, the music halted on his lips,
and his eyes became fixed in a terrified stare upon
a tree ten feet away.</p>

<p>Poised upon one of its branches, its eyes gleaming
with ferocious fire, just ready to spring upon
Bob, who, unconscious of his peril was gathering
an armful of fuel, was a panther.</p>

<p>For only an instant Ben was held breathless and
spell-bound by the curdling spectacle. Then with a
great shout and brandishing his stick wildly, he ran
forward to obstruct the spring of the fierce animal
and save his friend.</p>

<p>Too late! As the lithe creature darted through
the air, Ben reeled with horror, his eyes closed to
shut out the hideous sight and weakness and despair
overcame him.</p>

<p>Bang! What was that? A sharp report rang out.
Ben made out a strange form near the campfire with
a smoking rifle in hand. He saw the panther diverge
in its leap, turn completely over, and with a furious
snarl drop to the ground, while Bob, lifting his
head, demanded coolly:</p>

<p>“I say, what’s happening?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span></p>

<p>Ben ran to his side, clinging to his arm, faltering
out an incoherent explanation. Then in amazement
both advanced to the silent erect figure outlined like
some statue in the red glow of the campfire.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s an Indian,” broke out the wondering
Bob. “Say, hello!”</p>

<p>“How,” responded the stranger, with something
of subserviency in his manner. He was a mild-faced,
gentle-mannered half breed.</p>

<p>Ben grasped his hands and swung it up and down
fervently, pointing to the gun and then to the dead
panther.</p>

<p>“You have saved my friend!” he cried, touching
Bob’s shoulder lovingly with his free hand.</p>

<p>“Me friend,” pronounced the Indian awkwardly.</p>

<p>“Yes, you are my friend, too—my good friend.
What can we do for you?”</p>

<p>“Salt.”</p>

<p>“What is that?” inquired Bob strangely.</p>

<p>The Indian had a bag strung across his back. He
drew out of it a fat pheasant, evidently recently
killed, and just dressed and washed at some near
stream, for it was dripping with fresh water.</p>

<p>“No fire—no salt,” he said. “You salt?”</p>

<p>“Salt?” repeated Bob buoyantly. “Loads of it.
Why, about all we have got is salt—and pepper.
Look here.”</p>

<p>The lunch put up at the aero meet had included
a dozen hard boiled eggs. A salt and a pepper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
bottle had accompanied them. Very little of the
condiment had been used.</p>

<p>The Indian’s eyes sparkled, as he at the discovery
of a treasure, as he viewed the salt longingly. Then
he passed the pheasant over to Ben with an unctious
smack of the lips and the words:</p>

<p>“You cook—plenty salt.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and give you the bottle for yourself,” cried
the exuberant Bob, slapping the Indian on the shoulder
in a friendly familiar way. “I say, old chief,
where are we? Can you direct us to any town?
People, houses, white man’s wigwam, understand?”</p>

<p>“Wigwam,” grinned the half breed. “Oh, yes—yes,
so,” and he pointed south.</p>

<p>“You take us there?” inquired Ben eagerly.</p>

<p>“Morning. Me guide. See? Charge one dollar.”</p>

<p>“You shall have ten,” cried the delighted Bob,
“and a whole barrel of salt thrown in.”</p>

<p>The Indian could speak only a few words of
English and could not sustain any conversation with
them. When the pheasant was broiled they gave
him half of it. They passed him the salt bottle and
he was supremely happy. He made his share of
the fowl look as if it was coated over with frosting,
ate it clear to the bones, selected a place near the
fire, used his bag for a pillow, and was placidly snoring
inside of two minutes.</p>

<p>“Well, Ben, I guess we’re headed for home at
last,” observed Bob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span></p>

<p>“It looks so. I can hardly wait till morning to
start.”</p>

<p>“You won’t wake Powhattan until he’s all ready,”
declared Bob, as they turned in.</p>

<p>When Ben woke up in the morning, two large
fish, scaled and cleaned, lay on pieces of bark before
the smouldering fire. The Indian was missing, but
his rifle lay beside the bag that had served as his
pillow for the night.</p>

<p>“Where’s Powhattan?” inquired Bob, rousing up.
“Oh, there he is, taking a morning swim,” added
Ben, glancing past the thicket to where a little
stream flowed. “Breakfast provided, eh? Where
did the fish come from?”</p>

<p>“Our visitor must have got up early and gone
fishing,” explained Ben.</p>

<p>The fish were soon sizzling over the fire. Ben,
waiting to have them browned to a turn, happened
to glance at the rifle of the Indian and his game bag.</p>

<p>Something about the latter suddenly enchained his
attention. He advanced towards it, picked it up,
and uttered so vivid an exclamation of surprise that
Bob ran quickly to his side with the inquiring words:</p>

<p>“What now, Ben?”</p>

<p>“This bag.”</p>

<p>“I see it,” nodded Bob.</p>

<p>“Do you notice anything familiar about it?” asked
Ben, some latent excitement in his tones.</p>

<p>“Why—no.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span></p>

<p>“Look closer,” directed Ben. “See, it is made
of a strip of something caught into bag shape and
fastened with thorns. Do you notice the material?
A strip of canvas.”</p>

<p>“What of it?”</p>

<p>“Parafined canvas, too. See the wooden braces
at each end? Why, Bob, this is a piece of an airship!”</p>

<p class="center">THE LOST AVIATOR</p>


<p>“A piece of an airship!” repeated Bob excitedly.
“Ours?”</p>

<p>“The <em>Dart</em>, yes. The piece here is discolored and
looks old, but a day’s knocking around with this
Indian here would do that.”</p>

<p>“Then you figure out that he has discovered the
<em>Dart</em> and utilized what he fancied about it to make
a game bag, and this is it?”</p>

<p>“That is my guess.”</p>

<p>“Mine, too,” declared Bob. “If that is true, Ben,
then the Indian must know the spot where the
<em>Dart</em> is.”</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly.”</p>

<p>“Let’s find out. Hey, hi, hello, guide, my friend
Powhattan! This way, old fellow!”</p>

<p>The Indian, just through with his morning swim,
arrived speedily, smiling and as placid as ever.</p>

<p>“I say, look here,” said Bob, picking up the impromptu
game bag, “yours?”</p>

<p>“Me, yes—yes,” replied the Indian promptly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span></p>

<p>“Did you make it?”</p>

<p>The Indian bowed assent.</p>

<p>“Where did you get this?” asked Bob, patting the
canvas.</p>

<p>The Indian spoke a string of mingled words accompanied
by vivid pantomime. He imitated the
movement of wings and practically described an
airship.</p>

<p>“Can you take us to the place where you found
this?” asked Ben.</p>

<p>The Indian pointed southwest. He held up six
fingers.</p>

<p>“He means about six miles from here,” translated
Bob.</p>

<p>“I guess he does. You take us. Understand?
Then to the town, will you?”</p>

<p>The Indian held up two fingers now.</p>

<p>“He means two dollars,” declared Bob. “All
right my friend, twenty dollars, if you say so.
That’s the ticket, Ben. We’ll locate the <em>Dart</em> first,
so as to be sure we can find it later, and then have
our guide take us to the settlement. Zip! but we’re
getting action at last.”</p>

<p>The Indian seemed to understand what they
wished him to do. He ate his fish, using nearly all
the salt left, acted unusually satisfied and brisk, and,
breakfast despatched, the boys followed him single
file as he led the way from the spot.</p>

<p>They had gone about four miles when their guide<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
struck a narrow trodden path near the river. Its
banks were densely fringed with heavy underbrush
for over a mile. Then there was a break, an open
place of perhaps three hundred feet. Just before
reaching it, the Indian paused. He looked deeply
serious, almost alarmed, Ben fancied, as he placed
his finger warningly to his lips with the ominous
words:</p>

<p>“Follow—quick—run fast.”</p>

<p>“What’s the reason, Powhattan?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Shoot. Prisoner. Bad white men.”</p>

<p>“Oh, an enemy around, you mean?”</p>

<p>“Yes—yes. Come.”</p>

<p>The Indian shot past the break in the shore line
like a flash. Ben and Bob followed his directions.
As they did so, they noted an island in the river.
In its center stood a large log-framed building.</p>

<p>“That’s queer,” remarked Ben.</p>

<p>“Yes,” observed Bob, “it looks like some fort.”</p>

<p>“I wonder what there is to fear about it!”</p>

<p>“Can’t guess. I saw no one about, did you?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Ben, “it looked deserted to me.”</p>

<p>“Well, our guide is going ahead. Let us follow
him.”</p>

<p>Half a mile further on, the Indian turned into
a maze of high willow bushes. Abruptly these ended
in a kind of a swale. It was dry now, and they
crossed it without difficulty. Then, as Ben and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
Bob came to the middle of it, they halted dead
short.</p>

<p>“Hello!” projected Bob, “an airship.”</p>

<p>“But not ours!” cried Ben, lost in wonderment,
“not the <em>Dart</em>.”</p>

<p>The two friends stood bewilderedly staring at the
wreck of a monoplane lying flat upon the ground.
It was all in pieces. Some of the planes had been
cut into and trampled on. The wheels were missing,
and it had been stripped of many of its mechanical
parts.</p>

<p>“Ben, what does it mean?” inquired Bob blankly.</p>

<p>“You can see for yourself. It is simply another
airship than our own. It landed here by chance, just
as ours landed where it did. Some one has carried
away part of it.”</p>

<p>“Probably some one living in that queer place on
the island in the river.”</p>

<p>“Very likely.”</p>

<p>Their first surprise over, the young aviators made
a closer inspection.</p>

<p>“It is a Zenapin model, and was a good one,” reported
Ben. “I wish I knew where it started from.”</p>

<p>“Here’s something that may tell,” said Bob, abruptly
tugging at the front dip board. “It’s smashed,
but part of the name is left.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” inquired Ben, coming quickly to the
side of his companion.</p>

<p>“T—E—O—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span></p>

<p>“Only part of a name. What can it stand for?”</p>

<p>“Teodor? Hardly. Matteo? No, I give it up.”</p>

<p>“Hold on,” cried Ben, fishing among the scattered
debris. “Here’s another letter, or rather a part of
one.”</p>

<p>“An E,” said Bob excitedly. “Now, where does
that belong—before or behind?”</p>

<p>“Before—I’ve got it, Bob.”</p>

<p>“What—quick!”</p>

<p>“M-E-T-E-O-R.”</p>

<p>“Whew!”</p>

<p>Bob uttered such a gasp that it staggered him. He
repeated it, as he rapidly fumbled in his coat pocket
with the words:</p>

<p>“The <em>Meteor</em>? Why didn’t I think of it before.”</p>

<p>“Then you know something about the <em>Meteor</em>.”</p>

<p>“I guess I do.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“I’ll show you in a minute.”</p>

<p>Bob drew out his memorandum book. He extracted
several newspaper clippings from its inner
pocket. He selected one of these and read its heading:</p>

<p>“The Lost Aviator.”</p>

<p>“Who was it, Bob?”</p>

<p>“Count Eric Beausire, a French aviator. Made
a flight from Minneapolis last month. The <em>Meteor</em>
never heard from since. Supposed lost in the wilds
of Canada. One thousand dollars reward for any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
information concerning the whereabouts of Count
Beausire or his airship.”</p>

<p>“And this is the <em>Meteor</em>,” murmured Ben, immersed
and spellbound in a maze of speculation.</p>

<p>“And where is the lost aviator? Where is the
missing Count Beausire?”</p>

<p>It was decidedly gruesome to think of that. Involuntarily,
both boys looked all about them.</p>

<p>“He must have left the airship at some other
place,” said Ben. “There is no trace of him here.
It looks as if a good many people had visited this
place. If he fell with the <em>Meteor</em> he has been discovered.”</p>

<p>“What shall we do?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“What can we do except to get to some settlement
and report what we know, and have a search
made for both the missing aviator and the <em>Dart</em>.”</p>

<p>“It’s a thousand dollars for us, what we have already
discovered,” remarked Bob. “I’d give it to
find the count. He must have been a fine man, for
this newspaper clipping says that the reward is
offered by the big International Aviation Club of
New York.”</p>

<p>The Indian had been pacing about and looking
around him in a restless uneasy way ever since they
had arrived at the uncanny spot. He seemed greatly
relieved to start again on the course for the settlement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span></p>

<p>When they reached the break in the river hedge,
he again displayed anxiety and seriousness.</p>

<p>“Run fast,” he directed.</p>

<p>The boys started to follow his suggestions to
humor him. Half the open distance accomplished,
however, Ben came to a standstill. He looked over
towards the fort, like a structure on the island.</p>

<p>“What is it, Ben?” inquired Bob, coming back to
where he stood, while with every indication of terror
their guide scurried to cover.</p>

<p>“Did you hear a shout?”</p>

<p>“No, Ben.”</p>

<p>“Well, I did. It sounded like a cry of distress.
And see,” added Ben excitedly, “from that cellar
window. Some one is waving a handkerchief.”</p>

<p>“I see it—I see it,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“A shout for help and a signal of distress,” said
Ben thoughtfully, “Bob, I’m going to investigate this
mystery.”</p>

</div>

<p class="center">HOMEWARD BOUND</p>


<p>Ben beckoned to the Indian, but the latter refused
to come beyond the protecting fringe of bushes.
Ben approached him and pointed to the island.</p>

<p>“I want to go there,” he said.</p>

<p>The guide professed great concern and terror.
He was genuinely frightened. Nothing could prevail
upon him to accompany the boys. In a disconnected
way and with numerous gesticulations, he
made it clear that bad white men were somewhere
about the island waiting to annihilate all intruders.</p>

<p>“Why, the place is all shut up and looks practically
deserted,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“Except for the person waving at that window,”
added Ben. “Hark! he is shouting again. Let us
descend to the river bank.”</p>

<p>No demonstration of any kind greeted their exposing
themselves to full view from the island. At
first it looked as though they would have to swim
over. Then Bob discovered a light canoe hidden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
in among some high reeds. He and Ben got into the
craft and paddled over to the island.</p>

<p>As they approached the log structure at its center,
it suggested to them more of a fort than ever. It
was built solidly, had port holes here and there in
its sides, and marks in the logs showed where at
some time or other musket balls and even larger
projectiles had evidently assailed its staunch timbers
from the mainland.</p>

<p>“No one seems to be moving about,” said Bob.
“Even that man in the cellar has got out of sight.”</p>

<p>They walked about the building until they came
to a door letting into the cellar. This was protected
with a simple hasp and bolt. Ben opened the door,
Bob followed him into the cellar.</p>

<p>A somewhat remarkable sight greeted them.
Seated on a sawbench with an upturned barrel
before him was a man dressed in aviator costume.
He had a comb and some other toilet articles on the
barrel. With these he was arranging tangled disordered
beard and hair. He tidied up a very much
neglected collar and tie. He waxed his long mustachios
with a stick of cosmetic.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, I welcome!” he cried, and with
graceful agility he sprang to his feet and made a bow
like that of some courtier. Something jangled as he
did this, and quick-sighted Bob exclaimed in dismay:</p>

<p>“Ben, one foot is secured to a log chain running
to that center post.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span></p>

<p>“Who are you?” began Ben, but guessing.</p>

<p>“I am the Count Eric Beausire,” came the pleasant-toned
response, “but, greater than so, an aviator,
as you are, gentlemen,” and he looked up and down
the garb of the visitors.</p>

<p>“Yes,” responded Ben, “we have just made a long
distance flight on our monoplane, the <em>Dart</em>.”</p>

<p>“I greet you as brothers,” cried the count with a
glad gracious wave of his hand. “Ah, it is a pleasure
profound after weeks of confinement. Can I be released?”</p>

<p>“We shall see to that at once,” declared Ben, and
he and Bob made immediate inspection of the chain
that held the count a captive. It was fortunate that
they had some of the tools used in the monoplane in
the bag which Bob still carried. With even this
help and all Ben’s mechanical skill it took them
nearly two hours to get the count free.</p>

<p>The rescued man urged haste as they paddled
over to the mainland. They found the Indian cowering
and uneasy, and immensely relieved at their
safe return. Several allusions had been made to the
wrecked <em>Meteor</em>.</p>

<p>“I must see my beloved child of the air once more—a
sad farewell,” declared the count.</p>

<p>The boys led him to the swale brake. The nobleman
looked over the scattered ruins of the monoplane.
He selected a small piece of one of the
planes, lifted his cap reverently, pressed his lips to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
the little piece of wood, and placed it inside his
breast as a cherished memento.</p>

<p>“Vandals!” he exclaimed, taking a last look at
the wrecked airship and then shaking a clenched
fist towards the island.</p>

<p>The party now took up the march for the settlement,
much to the satisfaction of their Indian guide.</p>

<p>“I assume that the <em>Meteor</em> arrived in good condition
here originally,” began Ben, interested in
learning the story of the refugee who was now their
companion.</p>

<p>“Except for a dead motor, yes,” responded the
count. “I sought help. Misfortune led me to the
house on that island. Ah, the banditti!”</p>

<p>“Who are they?” asked Ben.</p>

<p>“As I learned later, merciless outlaws, the proscribed
of the commonwealth. There are ten of
them. Immediately I was viewed with suspicion.
Unfortunately I wore a star bearing secret symbols
upon it—a testimonial from a foreign court where
I had made an aero exhibition. These rabble took
it for a badge of a detective. They refused to listen
to explanations. I was chained up as a spy, the
<em>Meteor</em> ruthlessly destroyed. Ah, the vampires!”</p>

<p>“They were outlaws, you say.”</p>

<p>“I learned from what I heard and observed that
they were proscribed men with a price on their head,
the terror of the district. They have defied and even
held at bay the government for years. They have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
resisted a bombardment in their numerous fastnesses,
of which the island fort is one.”</p>

<p>“But we found you alone.”</p>

<p>“Yes. It seems they anticipated a visit from the
mounted police, and abandoned the island two days
ago. They promised to send a person to release
me after they had gotten over the border line.”</p>

<p>By this time the boys knew that they were over
two hundred miles over the American line in a wild
part of Canada. Their spirits rose as with their new
comrade they talked over all kinds of aviation
events, told their own experiences, and listened to
some thrilling stories of the count.</p>

<p>At last their Indian guide led them into a regularly
traversed trail. They had not followed this
any great distance when a trampling sound caused
them to draw aside. In a few minutes a cavalcade
dashed into view—the mounted police.</p>

<p>There were speedy explanations. The captain of
the party became immensely interested in the strange
stories of the refugees. He eagerly questioned the
count as to details concerning the outlaws. Then
he paid full attention to the story of the <em>Dart</em> from
Ben’s lips.</p>

<p>The latter explained to the official that he had
plenty of ready money provided by John Davis to
pay rewards and expenses. The result was that
the police were divided into two parties.</p>

<p>“If the outlaws have really gone, good riddance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
and we won’t follow them,” said the officer. “Let
one party visit the island and burn the old shack to
the ground. The rest of us will look for your lost
airship, Mr. Hardy, and report to you at the settlement.
We’ll be glad to have a hand in helping out
you aviators. There is a big interest in airships
everywhere, and we may get some helpful notice in
the newspapers.”</p>

<p>It was a decided satisfaction to Ben, Bob and the
count to sit down to a good meal in a comfortable
little hotel at the settlement two hours later. The
Indian guide was handsomely rewarded. A courier
had been hired to ride on horseback across country
to the nearest telegraph station with messages for
New York, Blairville and Woodville.</p>

<p>Before nightfall the captain of police came in
with a report of the findings of the <em>Dart</em>. Ben immediately
secured the services of a man owning a
large broad wagon, and the next morning the monoplane
was taken apart and packed on the vehicle.</p>

<p>Count Beausire took charge of the barograph and
distance register, sealed both, and announced that
he would accompany the boys to Blairville.</p>

<p>“My declaration as a representative of the international
aero clubs, will be accepted as to the veracity
of your exploit,” he observed, somewhat grandly.</p>

<p>Ben paid liberally all those working in his behalf.
Arrangements were made to ship the <em>Dart</em> to Blairville.
The motor and some other parts of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
wrecked <em>Meteor</em> were also to be sent forward, at the
request of Count Beausire.</p>

<p>The news quickly spread that the young aviators
had made a truly wonderful flight, and many came
to see Ben and Bob.</p>

<p>“I’ve got an extra telegram to send home,” said
Bob, and went off, leaving Ben alone at the hotel.</p>

<p>A little later our hero received a letter, asking him
to call at a certain address in the town, to see a new
invention of an airship. The letter added that Ben
would regret it if he did not pay attention to the
communication.</p>

<p>Curious to know what the invention might be, the
young aviator started off alone. Quarter of an hour’s
walk brought him to the address given. It was a
large, dilapidated house, and looked to be vacant.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t look as if the inventor was very prosperous,”
commented Ben to himself. “But I guess
none of them are when they’re working on flying
machines.”</p>

<p>He rang the bell, but no one answered. He looked
up at the front of the house. Many of the windows
were broken, and there was no sign of life.</p>

<p>“Guess I might as well walk right in,” he said.
“I’ll probably find him in one of the back rooms
puttering over some of his machinery.”</p>

<p>He went into the hall, his footsteps echoing
through the empty house. He made a tour of the
first floor, and soon came to the conclusion that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
inventor must be in one of the upper stories. He
got all the way to the top one before his search was
successful. Then a voice hailed him from one of
the rear rooms.</p>

<p>“Who is there?” a man called, speaking with a
slight German accent.</p>

<p>“I’m Ben Hardy,” called our hero, not observing
his questioner. “I came to inquire about a flying
machine. Are you the inventor?”</p>

<p>“I am, my young friend. I am glad you have
called. I am just about to make a flight, and you
shall see it.”</p>

<p>A big man, in his shirt sleeves, and with a ragged
pair of trousers on, stepped into view. He stood in
the door of a room far down the topmost corridor.
Ben advanced toward him, noting that the inventor
was of great strength, as indicated by his powerful
arms and shoulders.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t think you could go up very far in
a place like this,” said Ben pleasantly. “What sort
of a flying machine is yours, an aeroplane or the
gas-bag variety?”</p>

<p>“Neither,” replied the inventor. “Mine is on an
entirely new system. It is the screw principle, as old
as the world, but applied in a new direction. I am
the greatest inventor in the universe. My name is
Hans Voller. Come in and see my machine. It is
about to fly.”</p>

<p>He held open the door of the room. Ben could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
make out a mass of machinery, and a curious contrivance
like a big auger.</p>

<p>“We are about to fly!” exclaimed Hans Voller,
as he took our hero by the shoulder and shoved him
into the dingy apartment, following himself and
quickly locking the door. “We must have no spies,
for there are many who would steal my ideas,” the
man added.</p>

<p>Ben sized him up for a harmless crank, though
he did not like the locked door, nor the manner in
which the eyes of the German glared at him. Still,
the young aviator reflected, the man might be only
out of his mind on this one subject of flying machines,
and he had been in just as much danger, and
more, dozens of times since becoming a “bird-man.”</p>

<p>“Now attend!” exclaimed the inventor, as he put
the key of the room in his pocket. “I will explain
the principles on which this most wonderful machine
works, and then I will demonstrate it to you. You
will write it up for your aviation club, and I shall
become famous. Do you see that screw?”</p>

<p>Ben nodded to show that he did. It was a curious
contrivance of a double spiral, about seven feet high
and half that in diameter at the top, tapering down
to a point. It was made of woven basket work,
covered with cloth, and painted white. Our hero
compared it to two spiral stairways twined about
a centre pole, similar to one he had seen in a circus
once, and down which a man, shut up in a ball,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
had rolled from the top of the tent to the ground.</p>

<p>“That screw solves the problem,” the inventor
went on. “I revolve that thousands of times a minute.
It forces the air down, just as a screw of a
steamer forces the boat ahead through the water.
That lifts my machine up, and then I start my engine
and we go ahead. I have not yet made a big machine,
but I have tested this one by making it lift
heavy weights. I want it to lift a person. I am
too heavy for this little model, but you would be
about right.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I wouldn’t care to try it,” spoke Ben
with a laugh.</p>

<p>“There is no danger! You must try it!” the
German exclaimed. “See, I rotate the screw by
this electric motor I have installed. Sometimes it
gets going too fast and something breaks. Then I
must look out. I hide behind this wooden screen,”
and he pointed to a strong one near the mass of
machinery. “Now I have a chance to try my machine
on a live person. I have long wanted to. I
have made some improvements to-day, and you are
just in time. You will fly!”</p>

<p>Before Ben knew what was happening the inventor
had grabbed hold of him, pinning his arms to his
side, and was advancing toward the big screw, which
now began to revolve at a rapid rate.</p>

<p>Ben struggled to free himself, but the big German
held him tightly. His face was close to that of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
young aviator, and the youth could see a strange
gleam in the blue eyes. The hum of the motor as it
increased in speed sounded loudly in the room. The
big rattan screw was hissing as the blade cut the air.</p>

<p>“Let me go!” cried Ben. “I don’t want to try
your flying machine!”</p>

<p>“But you must!” insisted the inventor. “This is
an opportunity I have long waited for. All the
other airship men would not come in when they got
as far as the door. They were afraid of me, I
guess.”</p>

<p>Ben wished he had been more discreet, for he
realized that the man was a dangerous lunatic.</p>

<p>“You will soon be sailing through the air; right
up through the roof,” the German went on, still
holding Ben in his arms, while with one foot he
pushed over a lever on the floor, thereby increasing
the speed of the motor. “You will soon be among
the birds. Then you can come down and write
an account of it for the paper, and Hans Voller will
be famous.”</p>

<p>Ben was very much frightened. The man was
fairly crushing him in his terrible grip, and, as he
approached closer to the machinery, the youth saw
that the apparatus was strongly constructed and was
revolving at a speed so great that the spiral looked
like a thin white streak. The blades were not visible.</p>

<p>He could not imagine what the insane inventor
was going to do with him, unless he intended to toss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
him into the midst of the whirling screw. In this
event, though the material was only light rattan, our
hero was likely to be seriously injured, because of
the great speed. Also, there was danger that he
would come in contact with a live wire or part of
the big motor, the vibrations of which shook the
whole frail building.</p>

<p>But the German soon showed that he was not
going to do any immediate harm to the boy. He
suddenly laid the young aviator down on an elevated
platform, which Ben at once saw was part of
a scale for weighing big objects. The scale was
connected to the screw, and the arm, with the weight
on, was oscillating up and down.</p>

<p>Before Ben could wiggle away, the German had
passed some ropes over him, tying him securely
down on the platform. Then he sprang to his feet,
leaving the boy lying there, trussed like a fowl.</p>

<p>“Now we are ready to fly!” exclaimed the German,
his eyes flashing strangely.</p>

<p>Ben looked in vain for some way of escape. He
was tied so tightly he could scarcely move. Close
to his head on one side was the motor and on the
other the whirring screw, which made such a loud
humming that the German’s voice, loud as it was,
sounded faint and far off.</p>

<p>The inventor busied himself about his machinery
for several seconds, adjusting wires, wheels and levers.
Then he put some weights on the beam of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
the scale. Next he began to figure on some scraps
of paper, the while muttering to himself.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, we shall do it,” Ben heard him say.
“It is a success. He shall fly.”</p>

<p>“You’d better let me go before the police come!”
exclaimed the young aviator, thinking to frighten
the man. The German only laughed.</p>

<p>“The police never come here!” he cried. “It is too
lonesome a place. No one lives here but me. The
house is deserted. It is falling to pieces, for the
owner will not repair it. It is good enough for me.
No one shall disturb us.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do to me?” asked Ben,
growing a little calmer.</p>

<p>“I intend you shall fly—that is, theoretically, not
actually. This machine is only a model. I put you
on the scales. I start my screw. If this little screw
can so push against the air, with such force as to
cause the beam arm of the scale, with you on the
platform, to go up, I know I am successful. That
shows that if I make a bigger screw, and revolve
it in the opposite direction, so as to lift up, instead
of pulling down, as this is doing, I have solved the
secret of flying.”</p>

<p>The man seemed rational, and his language
showed he knew something of the laws of dynamics
and pneumatics, but his eyes had a dangerous
glare in them, and Ben, in spite of his outward coolness,
was much frightened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span></p>

<p>“I now prepare to revolve the screw at its highest
speed,” went on the German, and our hero wondered
if it could go any faster and not fly apart from
centrifugal force. “When it is at top speed, if the
beam of the scale goes up, I am the great inventor.
If it does not—I am nothing. Now we are ready.
You are going to fly, but you are not going to fly.
It is all in theory. But I must reverse the motor,”
which he quickly did. “I am afraid if I let the
screw revolve the other way you would go right out
through the roof. We may try that later. I am
going to put a string to the electric lever that controls
the motor, and pull it from the other room, as
there is danger from the great speed if I stay here.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to let me be killed?” cried Ben,
now thoroughly frightened, and believing that the
man meant to harm him. He certainly was in a
desperate plight.</p>

<p>“I hope no harm will come to you,” spoke the
German, with an unpleasant grin. “I have to have
some one on which to experiment. You are a good
one. I hope you escape. Do not move when the
screw begins to go faster.”</p>

<p>He had fastened a stout cord to the lever of the
electric switch that controlled the motor. This cord
he passed through the keyhole of the door, which he
unlocked. Then he went out into the hall, closing
the door after him, but not locking it, and leaving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
Ben, bound and helpless, alone in the room with the
strange machinery.</p>

<p>The motor was purring like a great cat, the screw
was whizzing around so swiftly just above his head
that it made our hero dizzy to watch it. Once more
he tried to break the bonds, but they were too tight.</p>

<p>“Look out now!” called the voice of the insane
inventor from the hall. “Tell me if the scale beam
moves!”</p>

<p>Ben saw the string that passed through the keyhole
become taut. He heard the spitting of fire as
the copper blade of the switch passed over the various
contact points, letting more current flow to the
motor. Then he heard the screw set up a shriller
hum, as its speed increased.</p>

<p>The scale platform on which he was lying shook
and trembled. The whole room vibrated as though
a strong wind was shaking the house. Sparks came
from the motor, and there was a roar like a miniature
cyclone in Ben’s ears.</p>

<p>“Don’t move!” cried the German from the hall.
“Lie still! Watch if the arm moves! You may go
through to the cellar! I am going down to catch
you!”</p>

<p>Then our hero heard footsteps retreating down
the hall. He was alone with the dangerous and rapidly
moving machinery, unable to help himself, or
to move in case the apparatus flew apart from the
awful force that was spinning it around. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
thought was too much for the boy, and he fainted.</p>

<p>How long he remained senseless he did not know,
but it could not have been more than a few minutes,
as after events proved. When he opened his eyes
again he saw a pleasant-faced German youth standing
over him, regarding him curiously.</p>

<p>“Ach, Herr Voller!” cried the newcomer. “I
find dot you are right on der chob, as dese Americans
say. I am a writer from der magazine. Der editor
sent me to get a story of your wonderful invention.
I come in, as I can make no one hear der
bell. I find you experimenting mit it. Tell me all
about it. Ven are you going to fly? But you speak
de German, and dis American he iss not so easy for
me,” and with that he launched into a flow of
German.</p>

<p>“Wait! Stop! Hold on!” cried Ben above the
din of the machinery. “I’m not the inventor of this
thing! He’s a crazy man, an he fastened me here to
experiment with. Cut me loose before he gets back!
Stop the machinery!”</p>

<p>“Vot is dot?” cried the magazine man, for such
he was. “You are not the inventor? You are tied
up by him? Stop der machinery? How shall I
do it?”</p>

<p>“First cut me loose!” cried Ben. “I’ll stop the
motor when I get up! It’s liable to fly to pieces
now!”</p>

<p>For several seconds the newcomer stood irresolute.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
It took the idea some time to get all the way
in, though when it did he was not slow to act. Whipping
out his knife, he cut the ropes that bound Ben.
The latter, as soon as he could stand, sprang to the
wall, where he had noticed the electric switch, and
shut off the current. The motor and screw slowed
down, and the hum of machinery stopped.</p>

<p>“It’s lucky you came along when you did,” said
Ben, who was quite pale from his adventure. “I
thought I was a goner.”</p>

<p>“How did all dis happen?” asked the German
magazine writer.</p>

<p>Our hero explained. It appeared that the German
magazine man had also received a letter, asking that
a reporter be sent to write up the flying machine.</p>

<p>“Dot luck you speak of, he is a queer thing,” said
the German, when Ben had finished his recital. “I
was going first to mine supper, but I dinks I get de
story first and eat myself afterwards. Dot is lucky
for you.”</p>

<p>“That’s what it is. Now we’d better get out of
here before that crazy inventor comes back. I don’t
know where he went, though he said he was going
to see if I fell through to the cellar.”</p>

<p>“Ach, if he is crazy, I wants none of him!” exclaimed
the magazine man. “Our life it is hard
enough widout such troubles!”</p>

<p>“Hark! Some one is coming!” cried Ben, as
footsteps sounded in the hall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span></p>

<p>The two made a dash for the door, and got into
the corridor just in time to see someone approaching.</p>

<p>“He’s coming back! We’d better try for the rear
way!” cried Ben.</p>

<p>But it was not the crazy inventor who was coming.
Instead it was a man in the uniform of an asylum
attendant.</p>

<p>The man questioned Ben and the magazine writer,
and then explained how the crazy man had escaped
from an asylum some months before. He had hidden
himself away so well that he could not be located.</p>

<p>“But we’ll get him now,” said the attendant, and
he was right; the crazy man was captured a little
later and taken back to the asylum.</p>

<p>“Gracious, I hope flying machines don’t make me
crazy!” said Ben, when telling Bob of what has
happened.</p>

<p>“They never will,” declared Bob. “Your head is
too level.”</p>

<p>It was a fine morning when the three aviators
bade their friends at the settlement farewell and
were driven over to the nearest railroad town. Then
life became an animated whirl to them.</p>

<p>Newspaper correspondents boarded the train at
half a dozen points down the line, eagerly pleading
for interviews.</p>

<p>The papers they read were full of the one great
popular current theme: “The Lost Aviators.” It
was a strange situation for Ben to read column after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
column covering every phase of public interest, anxiety
and speculation in regard to the missing <em>Dart</em>
and its crew.</p>

<p>It was before daylight the next morning that Ben
bade a temporary adieu to Bob and the count. This
was at a railroad junction between Blairville and
Woodville.</p>

<p>“I must see the folks,” he said. “I feel that my
first duty. I will come straight on to Blairville afterwards.”</p>

<p>Ben’s mother shed joyful tears to welcome home
again the lost boy whose disappearance had brought
many anxious hours of hope and fear. Ben had
a hasty breakfast and then took the first train for
Blairville.</p>

<p>He was thinking most of the result of the long-distance
race as he started for the aviation field. It
was with a token of interest, however, that he
glanced down the street where the man with the gig
lived. Ben had it in mind always to fathom the
mystery surrounding that individual when he had
aero affairs out of the way.</p>

<p>“Hello,” he exclaimed, coming to a halt. “There’s
the gig standing right in front of the house at this
very moment. My man must be at home.”</p>

<p>A little girl with golden curls, evidently the child
of the man he had sought so vainly, sat alone on the
seat of the gig. The horse was secured to an iron
ring on the stone curb.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span></p>

<p>Ben irresistibly started to walk slowly in the
direction of the house before which the gig stood.
Then with a thrill he sprang into lightning action.</p>

<p>A coal wagon half a block away suddenly dumped
its load down an iron chute through a manhole in a
sidewalk. The unusual rattle started up the mettled
animal attached to the gig.</p>

<p>With a jerk the horse snapped the hitch rein, and
with a wild leap the animal darted down the street.
The terrified little child on the seat uttered a shrill
shriek.</p>

<p>Ben buckled down to a tremendous sprint of
speed. He foresaw that the gig would turn the
corner. Making a diagonal cut, he reached the middle
of the cross road just as the gig swept past.
With a spring he caught the back of the high
seat, pulled himself over, and seized the little girl,
swaying from side to side, and just about to topple
to the stone paving blocks.</p>

<p>To his dismay Ben saw that the lines were dragging
under the feet of the flying horse. He clung
with one hand to the bar at the side of the seat. With
the other he seized the shrinking child by the arm.
Slowly, cautiously he lowered her over the back of
the gig. Not a foot from the ground he released
her.</p>

<p>She dropped so gently that she was not even
shaken, and simply swayed to one side with a slight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
shock. Ben was gratified to see a woman run out
into the street and pick up the uninjured child.</p>

<p>Then he turned around to decide on his own best
course—to get out of the gig or spring upon the
back of the flying horse and attempt to halt the furious
runaway.</p>

<p>Before he could make a move the horse made a
sharp veer down a side street. The gig was half
overturned and Ben was given a frightful fling.</p>

<p>The boy aviator flew through space, struck a
section of fence palings, went through them snapping
them into fragments, and landed senseless on
a garden plot beyond.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">CONCLUSION</p>


<p>Ben opened his eyes and looked about him. He
was lying in bed in a bright and cheerful room
that made him think instantly of home. He had a
quick mind, however, and at once knew that this was
not home. He tried to rise up, could not stir a limb,
and glanced over a trim dressed lady arranging
some medicine at a little stand.</p>

<p>“This is a hospital?” he observed.</p>

<p>“Dear me!” exclaimed the nurse. “You are
awake.”</p>

<p>“Am I hurt much?” was Ben’s prompt question.</p>

<p>“There are no bones broken,” replied the nurse,
coming to his side.</p>

<p>“How soon can I get up to the aviation grounds?”</p>

<p>“You strange boy!” voiced the astonished nurse.
“No fever, no delirium, good for at least two weeks
here, and talking about going to the aviation
grounds. I suppose you would start right off in
another of those dreadful airships——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span></p>

<p>“If I had the chance? Oh, sure,” laughed Ben.
“Why, what is there to be serious about?”</p>

<p>“You must ask the doctor, and here he comes,”
announced the nurse, stepping to one side.</p>

<p>Voices and footsteps sounded in the hall outside.
Ben caught the words spoken by one. The tones
were familiar, yet puzzling.</p>

<p>“Doctor,” a man was saying, “you have given the
boy the best room in the hospital?”</p>

<p>“The very best, sir.”</p>

<p>“No expense spared, if it’s a hundred dollars
a day.”</p>

<p>“He shall have every care.”</p>

<p>“And doctor,” added the voice pleadingly, “let
me see him. Just a word. Only to tell him my gratitude—the
hero who saved the life of my only treasure
in the world, my darling little Lena.”</p>

<p>“Come to-morrow morning, Mr. Knippel. He
must be kept quiet now.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” murmured Ben, “the man of the gig! It
was his child I helped at the runaway,” and then a
queer weak feeling overcame him, and he drifted
into a dream before he could learn or even think of
anything further.</p>

<p>Later in the day, however, Ben was awake once
more, and strong enough to learn that he had grazed
death very narrowly in that terrific runaway experience.
The hospital physician explained that
there were bruises and fractures that absolute rest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
alone could prevent from turning into something
critical. Ben took it all in seriously enough. Then
he surprised the doctor by suddenly laughing outright.</p>

<p>“You’re a merry chap,” observed the physician
brightly, “what’s the funny bone idea now?”</p>

<p>“Why, I was just thinking,” explained Ben,
“here I go hundreds of miles in an airship that
makes people shudder and escape without a scratch.
Then I take a fifty-yard ride in an old gig four feet
from the ground, and get a tumble that lays me flat.
Why, it’s like the old sailor who sailed the five
oceans for half a century, came home, fell into a
ditch with two feet of water in it, and drowned.”</p>

<p>There was a tap at the door, and the doctor admitted
Ben’s mother. She was too sensible a woman
to show her concern and make a scene. Not so
John Davis, however, who arrived shortly afterwards.
The big hearted old aviator sniffled like a
schoolboy at a sight of the pride of his eyes lying
helpless on a hospital cot.</p>

<p>“Why, the doctor says I’ll be as well as ever in
a week,” remonstrated Ben airily, but really affected
at the devotion of his good friend.</p>

<p>“I know, but we had arranged such an ovation
for you up at the field,” explained Mr. Davis.</p>

<p>“What were going to ovate about, Mr. Davis?”
inquired Ben quickly.</p>

<p>“Shall I tell him?” inquired the aviator, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
doctor nodded assentingly, and the blunt fellow
blurted out proudly:</p>

<p>“The <em>Dart</em> won the long distance event by two
hundred miles!”</p>

<p>“Say—say, that’s great!” aspirated Ben, his face
beaming. “We’re all rich.”</p>

<p>“And famous,” added the old aviator. “Oh, boy,
it was a gallant run!”</p>

<p>The grand news was enough to make any boy
well. Ben was sure he would be able to be up and
around in two days. The next morning he was
interested when a visitor was announced as Mr.
Knippel.</p>

<p>Ben was struck with the great change in the appearance
of this man since the time he had last
seen him. All the shrewd forcible look was subdued.
He trembled like a child, and tears stood in
his eyes and his voice broke as he poured out his
gratitude to the boy who had saved his only darling
child from a terrible death.</p>

<p>“It has changed my whole life,” he declared.
“I am about to give up my business. It has been a
bad business. This is a warning. I shall leave the
country. Lad, I’m not a poor man. Ask what
you will, it shall be yours.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that?” inquired Ben, fixing his eyes
on Knippel.</p>

<p>“Heartily.”</p>

<p>“Do you know a man named Tom Shallock?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Knippel shuffled and colored. He looked embarrassed,
but he nodded assentingly.</p>

<p>“I have only one favor to ask,” said Ben. “I
have reason to believe that this man Shallock has
plotted against my father, that you have in your
keeping a document of great importance which Shallock
stole from my father.”</p>

<p>“Boy, that is true,” admitted Knippel, greatly
agitated. “But tell me more. I only know a part
of Shallock’s affairs.”</p>

<p>Ben recited the whole story of the stolen contract,
of the suspected visits of the Shallocks to the Hardy
home, of Saxton’s accusation of theft against his
father. Knippel rose to his feet with a determined
look on his face when the recital was concluded.</p>

<p>“I shall go from here at once to your father’s
lawyer at Woodville,” he promised. “The stolen
document shall be restored—more, the Shallock plot
against your father’s good name shall be exposed.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Ben.</p>

<p>“No, it is I who thanks you,” replied Knippel in
broken tones, “and my little child blesses you every
day.”</p>

<p>The following Monday morning, Bob Dallow,
chipper as a lark, came to the hospital for Ben in
an automobile. Ben was overcome with the greetings
that welcomed him at the aviation field. Everybody
was packing up to get away, but the Davis
quarters were crowded with congratulating professionals,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
and a big feast was spread. Ben enjoyed
a happy time. Count Beausire had delayed his departure
to say good-bye to him.</p>

<p>“Expect an honorary membership from the International
Aero Club, my good friend,” he said in
parting.</p>

<p>Ben wondered what had become of Dick Farrell.
He questioned one of the helpers around the flying
machines concerning that individual.</p>

<p>“What, ain’t you heard about Farrell?” asked the
man in surprise.</p>

<p>“Not a word—that is, since I came back.”</p>

<p>“He’s gone.”</p>

<p>“Where to?”</p>

<p>“A whole lot of fellows would like to know that—Burr
Rollins especially.”</p>

<p>“Then he left rather suddenly?” questioned our
hero, curiously.</p>

<p>“He did—for he had to.”</p>

<p>“Tell me what you know.”</p>

<p>“Well, it was this way, the nearest I can get to it.
Farrell and Rollins got into some kind of a quarrel.
What it was about I don’t know, but I heard ’em
having some hot words, and some other men heard
it too. Then, out of spite, what does Farrell do but
run the <em>Torpedo</em> into some old building and smash it
up, top, bottom and sides. Maybe Rollins wasn’t
mad.”</p>

<p>“What did he do?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span></p>

<p>“He couldn’t do nothing. He wanted to have
Farrell locked up, but Farrell got out of sight. Then
Rollins got into some sort of trouble with the aero
managers and he got out too. But before he left
he told a friend of mine that Farrell had not only
wrecked the flying machine but also taken two hundred
dollars of his money and his watch.”</p>

<p>“That certainly was a loss,” commented Ben.</p>

<p>“Yes, it was, but, in one way, I don’t sympathize
with Rollins. He wasn’t no square man, and it was
a mistake to let him enter any of the contests.”</p>

<p>“Is he going to build another flying machine to
take the place of the <em>Torpedo</em>?”</p>

<p>“That I don’t know. But I do know one thing—I
don’t want anything to do with him,” returned the
man.</p>

<p>“Nor I,” concluded our hero.</p>

<p>Mr. Davis and Bob, on invitation, accompanied
Ben to Woodville. They put in the first day in a
rare whirl of excitement and pleasure. They inspected
Mr. Hardy’s Airatorium. They visited the
Diebold works, and in the evening they formed a
merry gladsome group in the pleasant Hardy home.
Ben thought he had never seen his father and mother
look so pleased and happy.</p>

<p>Bluff Caleb Dunn walked in on them about nine
o’clock. He feigned his usual grim manner, but
Ben saw that the hard-headed old fellow was secretly
greatly pleased about something.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span></p>

<p>“Well, Hardy,” observed Dunn, “I’ve attended to
the business you’re too easy and good natured to
attend to yourself.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Mr. Hardy mildly.</p>

<p>“All hands are satisfied, so we’ll make a public
meeting of it,” went on the practical old fellow.
“The whole secret is out. That man Knippel before
leaving the country delivered that contract about the
automobile patents to your lawyer, Mr. Pearsons.
We have just got through showing it to old Saxton
and his lawyer and calling them down to terms.”</p>

<p>“How was it settled?” asked Mr. Hardy.</p>

<p>“Saxton has agreed to restore to you seventy-five
per cent. interest in all the patents. He claims the
other twenty-five per cent. for financing and promoting
the inventions.”</p>

<p>“Does that seem enough?” questioned the fair-minded
Mr. Hardy.</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” cried Caleb Dunn with good-natured
sarcasm. “Ought to have given Saxton the whole
thing, as you tried to do once. We’re your guardians,
and we nailed the old skinflint down to the last
cent we could. So that’s all settled. The whole secret
came out. It was Tom Shallock who stole the contract
from you. He held it as a threat over Saxton,
and that was the mystery of his influence with the
old man. Saxton has fired Shallock now, though.”</p>

<p>“What for?” inquired Ben.</p>

<p>“Stealing. He and his son Dave, and that precious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
Dick Farrell have been stealing supplies from
the Saxton works for years. They belonged to a
ring of junk dealers. That man Knippel headed the
crowd. They had secret signs, and that pin you
found in your work shed was an emblem of their
order. Dave Shallock dropped it there the night
he dumped a bag of fittings in the shed. His father
put up the contract with Knippel as security for
money he borrowed. The whole plot has been exposed,
the Shallocks are disgraced, and your father’s
name, Ben, comes out clear as crystal.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I am so glad and happy!” murmured Mrs.
Hardy.</p>

<p>“There’s more, too,” announced Mr. Dunn.</p>

<p>“Tell it,” said Mr. Hardy.</p>

<p>“Saxton is all broken up, and he is going to sell
out to the Diebold people. That means a new manager,
Hardy, and you’re the man.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” said the delighted Mrs. Hardy.</p>

<p>“As to you, old grumbler,” Caleb Dunn hailed
Mr. Davis pleasantly, “I heard you railing around
about being too old to sail around in the air much
longer.”</p>

<p>“And clumsy,” added the old aviator.</p>

<p>“Very well, here’s your chance: You know the
aviators all along the line. The Diebold company
will pay you more money than you ever earned before
to sell the Hardy new model monoplane.”</p>

<p>“That’s a go,” declared Mr. Davis enthusiastically.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
“It gives me congenial employment and keeps
me in touch with my old friends.”</p>

<p>“Of course Ben and I are independent,” observed
Bob, jingling some gold coins in his pocket, “but
we’d like a show at some honest employment.”</p>

<p>“Till school begins again,” supplemented Ben.
“You know, Bob, you agreed to attend to the education
feature while you had money to do it.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Dunn. “In the meantime though,
Bob can pick up a few dollars selling the airship men
supplies, and Ben can take charge of adjusting
them.”</p>

<p>“The very thing!” cried Bob, “so long as Ben and
I work in a team, we’ll be both satisfied.”</p>

<p>And the flying machine boys shook hands over the
bargain, and everybody was happy.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
